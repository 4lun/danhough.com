Just like in 2012 I'm going to try to limit how much I speak about each book I've read. Some I can't limit, but this time, two tweets worth is the goal: 280 characters or fewer. If you want to read my ramblings a bit check the source of the page.

### [Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Androids-Dream-Electric-Sheep-MASTERWORKS-ebook/dp/B003FXCSNQ/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_nC?tag=daplad-21) by Philip K. Dick (fiction)

Basis of Blade Runner. Much more haunting and depressing than the Ridley Scott film. More direct link to and understanding of the mind of the protagonist. Less action, more psychology.

### [The Aquariams of Pyongyang](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aquariums-Pyongyang-Years-North-Korean/dp/1843544997?tag=daplad-21) by Kang Chol-Hwan (non-fiction)

Animated account of life in a North Korean Gulag where Kang spent part of his life. Strikes me as honest and balanced, with what might be a typical North Korean attitude. Includes details about country's slow downfall and realistic description of the challenges of reunificaiton.

### [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry-ebook/dp/B0063HC7EQ/ref=sr_1_1?tag=daplad-21) (non-fiction?)

Well-told tale of rediscovery of oneself. I don't want to reveal too much here, because it's a great journey to take as a reader without knowing much beforehand. Explores many philosophical ideas in respectively small amounts of detail. Travel/adventure/philosophy/family story.

### [Lie and Let Die: James Bond 007](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-Let-Die-James-Bond-ebook/dp/B008FQBA2I?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

Strange and interesting glimpse into a different world from ours particularly from a social equality perspective. I also started to get to know a Bond with a lot more character and depth than the one we see on the silver screen. A Bond who really, really likes his breakfast.

### [Down and Out in Paris and London](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paris-London-Penguin-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B002RI9IT2?tag=daplad-21) by George Orwell (non-fiction)

Excellent explanation of poverty and homelessness which I'd never encountered. Changed my views. Here's a particular excerpt which I highlighted:

> I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a begar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, or enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning.

It's a very unpatronising book which seeks no sympathy; it is merely an account of Orwell's time experiencing poverty first-hand and the effect it has on the human spirit. It's a very easy read and I would recommend this book to anybody who has never had anything close to a first-hand experience of homelessness. I remember thinking after reading it that maybe we should all spend a bit more time being down-to-earth.

### [The Cargo Ship Diaries](http://www.amazon.com/The-Cargo-Ship-Diaries-countries-ebook/dp/B00JDNAQ36?tag=daplad-21) by Niall Doherty (non-fiction)

Doherty is self-obsessed and a bit narcissitic. But he seems like a very nice guy struggling to figure out what he wants from life. This account of his nomadic life includes a lot of great ideas and suggestions for how to deal with certain situations on the road. Easy, fun read.

### [The Time Machine](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Machine-Enriched-Classics-Pocket-ebook/dp/B00APIJZGC/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?tag=daplad-21) by H.G. Wells (fiction)

Classic sci-fi from a bygone era which still amazes me and makes my imagination go wild. H.G. Wells was before his time.

### [American Gods](http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Gods-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0755322819?tag=daplad-21) by Neil Gaiman (fiction)

Based on a really interesting and well-executed idea behind the notion of "gods". Attention to detail and use of the "blank slate" character is superb. If you're interested in religion and it's place in the 21st Century give this a read.

### [A Little History of Philosophy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-History-Philosophy-Nigel-Warburton/dp/0300187793?tag=daplad-21) by Nigel Warburton (non-fiction)

Readable and accessible, great to give a basic level of understanding the history of philosophy and all of it's greatest contributors. Note also that this is a history of *Western* philosophy and doesn't touch on ideas from the East. Great intro to a large and fascinating subject.

<!-- Nigel does touch on some of his own opinion at times but in general stays quite unbiased and delivers all the different philosophies of the 40 thinkers features in a way which seems very fair. -->

### [Moonraker](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Moonraker-James-Bond-Vintage-Classics/dp/0099576872?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

This is the third Bond novel, and this is the point in my reading of 007's Adventures when I started to get hooked. It is a tense tale, so much more serious than the others. Really great.

### [Superfreakonomics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Superfreakonomics-Cooling-Patriotic-Prostitutes-Insurance/dp/0141030704?tag=daplad-21) by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner (non-fiction)

Great storytellers. They raise interesting questions and are not afraid to cover hard topics which question morality itself.

<!-- The large parts dedicated to the US healthcare was a bit boring for me, either because I don't have the same built-in connection that many readers would in the US heathcare system, or because I'm just a bit ignorant. -->

### [Diamonds are Forever](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diamonds-are-Forever-Vintage-Classics/dp/0099576880?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

The Bond novel which most represents the character of James Bond to me. Showing signs of maturing, which is an interesting and welcome feature of the story. Great twists, very readable and sensible amount of action which is a nice chane from the previous.

<!-- The setup for the story (starts out in an African desert, skips to the UK, skips to the US, and then back again) is compelling. There are some genuinely good twists which really took me by surprise. Very readable. It's nice that Fleming leaves out gory details in some parts, which are not necessary for underscoring the cruelty of his captors (weâ€™ve had plenty of that in previous episodes). -->

### [Daemon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daemon-Daniel-Suarez/dp/1847249612?tag=daplad-21) by Daniel Suarez (fiction)

Very exciting and gripping. Finished wanting more, and I was able to empathise with characters on both sides of the conflict. Suarez makes many unnecessary computing references, however they are fairly accurate and informed. Ends on neither high nor low note.

<!--
This is a story about "the Great Diffusion", related to the rise of superintelligent machines, which was a much-debated topic in 2014. Interestingly, this story does not seem to end on either a high nor a low note. If you're interested in the "digital revolution" or the rise of intelligent machines, and like a political war-related story, this is a good book for you to read.

Here's some spoilery notes...

I don't get the ending. I am not sure if there is a moral there except to demonstrate Sobol's remaining humanity - the fact that his avatar at the end is post surgery. Maybe he found some soul in his final days to give humanity a chance to redeem itself.

Anyway, style wise Suarez annoys me a little, making many unnecessary computing references. However, his references, when they are or aren't necessary, are fairly accurate or seem accurate.

A great thing about this story is how it doesn't seem to end on a low note nor a high.

It is complex full of many different characters and is I think a realistic vision of a digital revolution which is unlike the "revolution" which the media portrays.

He plays on many cynicalities of modern society including wars on drugs and terror.

Sometimes its hard to tell whether Suarez is misogynistic or his characters. But not always.

The Great Diffusion!

Very gripping story. Very compelling. Want to see what happens next. I can empathise with protagonists on both sides of the war.
-->

### [Terra](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Terra-1-Mitch-Benn/dp/0575132108?tag=daplad-21) by Mitch Benn (fiction)

Terra is a sweet, comedic tale about an out-of-place human on an alien planet which explores morality and friendship and all those lovely things. It's a little bit teenagery, some of the jokes a bit too spelled-out. But it's fun and an easy read.

### [The Birth of Korean Cool](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Birth-Korean-Cool-Conquering-Through/dp/1471131041/?tag=daplad-21) by Euny Hong (non-fiction)

Hong's account of South Korea's transformation from nigh-on third-world status to global cultural superpower is a fun and interesting tale. She does not sell the country short and does justice to a frankly mind-blowing and impressive transformation over a short time.

<!-- However, she comes across rather strongly as being a bit too anti-Japanese at times and a little overly patriotic. This isn't surprising, though, given Korea's history with Japan. Hong's explanation of Korea's motivation is *han*, a certain combination of fear and resentment only Koreans can feel, which makes the book come seem sometimes like a very long humblebrag. Nevertheless, very entertaining and full of some interesting information about one of the world's coolest countries. -->

### [From Russia with Love](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Russia-Love-James-Vintage-Classics/dp/0099576899?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

Great! Full of premonitions and mystery. It's got everything a spy novel should have: Sex, suspicion, adventure, explosions, murder, double-crossing, and a good, strong dose of humour! This is almost a tale of a man whose life has gone stale, and how his guard gets let down. The complexity of Bond's character on paper is so much greater than in the movies.

<!-- 
SPOILER DISCUSSION:
Amazing things about this one:

* The moon thing. Days before Bond is attacked by Grant, Fleming makes many references to the three-quarter moon, as if to suggest that the time for Bond's assassination was coming close
* The change from the Russian perspective to Bond's is so sudden and so contrasted, it is amazing that Fleming can write to empathetically with SMERSH. It's beautiful. He doesn't make the Russians out to be cold, kiniving, evil people - he just tells the story as if he were one of them.
* The way Fleming describes Nash is perfect. The whole time, up to the very moment that he turns on Bond, the reader is left wondering whether he is Grant or not. All signs point to yes but it's hard to tell! The name, the build, the hair - but it can't be him, how would the Russians know the code??
* The breakfast is absolutely fantastic
* It ends on such a positive, high note with Bond hilariously fainting.
* Bond is actually quite comical and pathetic in many ways.
* Fleming is so good at describing environments.
 -->

### [Embassytown](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Embassytown-China-Mieville/dp/033053307X?tag=daplad-21) by China Mieville (fiction)

The plot of this story is complex but well told. It is a drawn-out, detailed novel. The story is astoundingly imaginative, and I'd love to get a glimpse inside the mind of Mieville. But the real meat of this book isn't in the story it tells. It's the ideas that it puts across about the nature of language and how it affects the way that we think and the way we perceive the world.

<!-- Some interesting techniques Mieville uses to tell the story which I liked:

* Rather than lots of exposition, details about the universe were slowly eked out in a subtle manner. Terms were introduced and used long before they were explained.
* The dialogue is very realistic. When a character is talking ambiguously because of some context which other characters are part of, they don't make themselves clear in the diaglogue, but the text makes clear what they were saying. -->

### [Dr No](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dr-No-James-Vintage-Classics/dp/0099576929?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

Just as things are starting to get boring for our hero, he's thrown into a life-or-death struggle with quintessential Bond villain, Dr No. Gripping, really fun characters.

<!--

Shows a side of Bond which allows him to sympathise with the "fairer" sex a little more. Perhaps this is a feeble attempt by Fleming to appeal to women readers. Not the best story so far but easily the most gripping.

Bond's sidekick in this one is my favourite so far. Self-made, self-taught island woman, very admirable.

This book is the point at which Bond villains and the story become quite far-fetched. That's no bad thing, though. It keeps the story interesting and highlights how Bond's status in the Service is reflected by the level of criminality he has to deal with. -->

### [Goldfinger](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Goldfinger-James-Bond-Vintage-Classics/dp/0099576937?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

Auric Goldfinger's plot is genius, but our heroes save the day once again with an even better counter-plot. This is a particularly interesting book in the series because the villains are far-fetched and rather more pantomime than some of the earlier ones (Dr No excluded).

<!--
Quite a lot more fun in many ways than earlier ones, and very gripping.

The way Bond dismisses his companion's disregard for him as, "she wasn't much into men" is ridiculous! The things he got away with! And of course at the end he "turns" Pussy Galore. Of course he does.

At any rate, the way that this book showcases a bunch of slightly less believable, more pantomime villains. The sort that wouldn't seem out of place in Batman. But I love it! They're full of character and very interesting. Fleming's ability to empathise with villains is one of his strengths: rather than portraying them all as evil, he portrays them mostly as businesspeople or people with less-than-stellar respect for the law. -->

### [For Your Eyes Only](http://www.amazon.co.uk/For-Your-Eyes-Only-Classics/dp/0099576945?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

A few short stories about Bond and his adventures. Some characters, including those in the "For Your Eyes Only" story are a lot of fun, though. Quantum of Solace is brilliant. Unlike any other story so far because it's told by a character that Bond is talking to. To me it's a story about how people can often end up being much more interesting than one first supposes they are. Important lesson, and well told.

### [Thunderball](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thunderball-James-Bond-Vintage-Classics/dp/0099576953?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

James Bond and Felix Leiter take on the secretive and cunning SPECTRE. This story shows signs of Bond's (as well as Leiter's) aging - getting grumpier and more sensitive in his old age. This is an exciting and time-critical story.

<!-- The stint in Wormwood Scrubs and the reaction to tourist treatment in Nassau show off his softer side. It's a little over-the-top with the sea-related adventure at times but I can see how the underwater battle would make for a good scene in a film, which is what this story was designed for in the first place. -->

### [Zero to One](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Start-Future/dp/0753555182) by Peter Thiel (non-fiction)

A book supposedly "on startups", it tends to go off-track at times especially with education rants. Overall though the messages are inspiring, laced with hard truths that many engineer types with entrepreneurial dreams probably need to hear.

<!-- It is at times hard to see the larger points that Thiel is making, especially when he goes into a rant about the US Education System. The tangents, from talking about the future of humanity and cults of celebrity, are still related back to the original one eventually -->

### [The Spy Who Loved Me](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spy-Who-Loved-Me-Classics/dp/0099576961?tag=daplad-21) by Ian Fleming (fiction)

Departure from previous Bond novels. Narrated by a Canadian woman, rather than by Fleming, the majority of the book does not feature Bond. It's an interesting approach, and very interesting to see how Fleming imagine's a woman's thoughts to be.

<!-- It seems to me almost to be a message to fans who see themselves becoming infatuated by the James Bond not to get too caught up in the fiction.  Mostly it doesn't seem too harmless to me, but he takes a few slightly unusual liberties. By far the most unusual one so far, it certainly mixes things up a bit. -->

### [The Martian](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0091956145?tag=daplad-21) by Andy Weir (fiction)

Near-future survival/shipwreck story on Mars. Things go wrong, things go right. You'll feel the elation and the sadness with our hero Mark and the people on Earth trying to save him. Extremely gripping, lots of fun, full of science. So, so good.

## Retrospective

As you can see, I got through quite a few books this year (at least by my standards). In fairness, the Bond novels are quite easy reads, so it's not too impressive - but I was lucky in that I mostly chose books that I got quite hooked on pretty quickly.

I think my favourite book of the year was Embassytown followed closely by The Martian. That came as a real surprise, as I didn't know what I was getting into - I went solely on a recommendation of a friend. I'd urge anybody reading this to have a look, it's a very thought-provoking and exciting story.

Oh, and if you've read any of the books above and wanna see some spoiler discussion, check the source of this page, I've included more for some of them.

## 2015

I'm going to finish all of Ian Fleming's Bond novels early on, and go and watch the films (I've never seen any of the films pre-Brosnan). But there are only a few left, so there'll be plenty of time to take on larger projects. Of the books I got for Christmas there's The Dice Man and Lila, the sequel to Zen and the Art of Motorcyle Maintenance, as well as the latest edition of the Darwin awards. But I'd like to read more about Korea (North and South), too, so if anybody reading this has a recommendation I'd love to hear it.

Anyway, happy New Year. I hope some of the books above tickle your fancy. Happy reading, folks.
