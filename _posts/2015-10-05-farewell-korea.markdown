"He speaks Korean," says the lady to her travel companion. "I'll put your bag up in the locker?" she offers politely.

"Is it okay?" I half-mumble in Korean. This is the first conversation in this language that I've had in the last week-and-a-half since I left *The Land of the Morning Calm* to visit Japan with my girlfriend Elli. Even such a short visit to Korea's neighbour to the south-east can weaken the neurological pathways which serve to translate my native tongue into the explosive and abrupt sounds of the Korean peninsula.

You see, I'm on a plane from Narita in Japan to Incheon, the airport city near Seoul. I have merely 18 hours left in South Korea before I leave for China, probably for the last time on this trip. I'm excited at the various destinations ahead of me, but there's a sense of sadness - I'm not quite done with Korea.

There are other countries to see in this part of the world, though, and I'd be a fool to miss out on the opportunity to see them. My feelings about this are similar to my feelings about leaving a job I've been at for a long time: better to leave when things are still good *and* the idea of leaving is somewhat exciting. I'd rather leave Korea behind knowing that one day, perhaps for a longer period, I'll return.

You'll probably know from [/blog/in-seoul](previous) [blog/average-day-in-seoul](posts) that I spent some time learning Korean at language school. The class was a mixed-nationality group: three Russians, four Chinese, one Taiwanese, four Japanese, one German and me, the sole Briton. The school has a policy of avoiding students' native langauges, which works surprisingly well.

Picture, if you will, a smart-looking lady at the front of a small classroom making an "Ack" sound. Before she can release the air that English-speakers would release at the end of that sound, she stops suddenly, waves her hand in front of her mouth and the sound simply ends as an "Ah" with a *slight* "ck" at the end. The does the same of "Abp", too.

At no point will she explain how it works with words in English, Chinese or Japanese, despite demonstrating in other, less important moments, that she is capable in these languages. She also avoids Russian, but we're fairly sure that she doesn't speak it anyway.

The classes followed the restriction 90% of the time, and sometimes there'd be a conversation in non-Korean between classmates or, very briefly, between teacher and student.

## Gratitude

The level of generousity and trustworthiness displayed the people of these countries would astound many people from the west.

For instance, there was the convenience store clerk who took me in, soaked, in the middle of the night in the pouring rain, served me hot coffee, gave me a towel and then kept my phone safe at his home even though I left it behind. Plus, there was the woman who spent half an hour helping me try to find it.

That reminds me of the time a friend left their wallet on a table in the chicken restaurant, and the owner hopped on a scooter and chased us down the road on the way to the station to return it.



## Comparing Korea and Japan

If you ask people about Korea and Japan they'll usually fall into two camps. Those who say, "Korea is very similar to Japan, but there are some important differences," and "Japan and Korea are very different places."

I think I used to be in the former camp. Now that I've *returned* to both after some time away, I've gained a different perspective. To a foreigner, it might be easy to spot the similarities: both countries are very fond of rice, and chopsticks are the main eating utensils for both Koreans and Japanese. They both use wax food to advertise menu items in restaurants and often those menu items will include some kind of pork cutlet covered in breadcrumbs (Tonkatsu in Japanese, Donkkaseu in Korean).

Yet for all these little features the countries share, there are many more subtle but important differences which aren't as easy to notice at first.

Firstly, I'll address language. English is not anywhere near as common or well-spoken in the parts of Korea I visited compared to the parts of Japan I visited. If you want to pick up some Korean, it's much easier in my opinion to do so than trying to pick up Japanese. The written language of Japanese is far more complicated than Korea's Hangul, with three separate scripts used interchangeably compared with Hangul's one, famously intuitive script.

Secondly, there's the customs. A common belief is that Japan is a very polite country. I can confirm, based on my experience, that Japan is in fact a very polite country. By British standards, the way that Japanese people talk to each other and to outsiders is bloody respectful indeed. In fact, it's respectful to the point of discomfort at times, as in many cases I felt like I was putting everyday people out of their way to do nice things for me.

Koreans, on the other hand, don't go to such lengths in every
