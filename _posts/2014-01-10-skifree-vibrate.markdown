I just updated [SkiFree.js](http://basicallydan.github.io/skifree.js) so that it vibrates your phone when you hit a rock or a tree. Sadly, I don't have a phone with a browser which supports it to enjoy this super-cool new feature, but maybe you do? If you have the latest Firefox on Android, or the latest Chrome Beta on Android, then you're all set. Have a go and let me know how it feels. Maybe it's weird, or too short or too long? [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/basicallydan/skifree.js/issues).

Remember, if you want to use the Vibrate API, listen to what [Terence Eden has to say about](http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/01/malicious-use-of-the-html5-vibrate-api/) it first. **Don't be evil.** Use it for cool, fun, non-malicious stuff like SkiFree.js.

Thanks, of course, to Terence, for introducing me to this API with his blog post. Now, wanna play [SkiFree.js](http://basicallydan.github.io/skifree.js)?
