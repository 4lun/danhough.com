Something that I've re-learned (which I already knew) at SxSW is that I am very good at talking to people as long as I am in the right mood.

I am a very polarised character - I am either hugely excited about something or massively down about it. All it can take is someone validating my idea with a "Wow, this needs to happen!" to make me feel better about it.

I met two people this week who are very well-respected in their fields. They are both powerful, well-loved and in-demand for their time, thoughts and opinions. They are both inspirational characters.

**One of them loved my idea,** and pretty much echoed it as I spoke. The other one **thought it was terrible**.

Thus began the emotional rollercoaster that has been the South by South-West festival.

Sharing the idea with other people is key - because you're going to get all kinds of feedback from different people about different things. A lot of people think Instagram is great - I'm not so keen about it. Many people think that it would be great for Google Glass to be a ubiquitous feature of everyday life but loads think that it's the end of socialising as we know it, in the worst possible way.

My point is that **it's important to take the bad with the good** and to **learn how to deal with that negative feedback**. Listen to it, take it in, and channel it into improving your idea. Channel that feedback into a place where it can actually make your idea more rock-solid so that next time you come across somebody ready to give negative feedback, they won't - they'll love it.

I have learned a whole lot more from SxSW so far. Maybe I'll write a summary when it's over.
