I have been offered, and I have accepted, a contract position working for a young British startup called [upmysport](https://www.upmysport.com/), based in the mountain town of Chamonix, in South-eastern France near the border with Switzerland.

I'll be living in Chamonix for three months, working alongside an old colleague from Huddle and one of the other co-founders, after which I'll return to London and continue what I'v been doing since I started this foray into independence.

Upmysport, for those who do not know, is a marketplace for Sports Instructors (including snowsports) whose goal is [to inspire more people to reach their potential by making it easier to find and book the right instructor, course or class](https://www.upmysport.com/about-us).

Back in November 2013 when I began as an Independent Software Developer I did not know quite what I would be doing over the following few months, but I did not expect I would spend much time in the Alps. It was not part of my plan, but then again, not many things were.

Luckily, I will be armed with a MacBook, a snowboard, and plenty of body armour, and hopefully there will be more to learn during my stay than just a lot of new things about mobile app development. I am massively excited, but also massively terrified. Despite being a life-long traveller to various countries and born ex-pat, the prospect of working abroad is a little bit new to me.

Nevertheless, I'm really looking forward to it. There's a great team to work with, and a great problem to help solve. I have no doubt that the next three months are going to be a hoot, full of challenges, surprises and lots of fun.

If anybody has any tips about working abroad, or lives in Chamonix and fancies a beer when I arrive, that'd be great :)

Common French phrases which are useful for programmers are also welcome.
