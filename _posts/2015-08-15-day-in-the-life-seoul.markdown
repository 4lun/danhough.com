Every now and then, in a cafe, bar or shop, a friendly-looking worker will bring you something you didn't order, and mention something about "soh-biss-eu". What they're actually saying is "service", which is the Korean way of saying "It's free. Just for you. Nobody else. No, this isn't a promotion."

Service accurately represents up the general attitude I've received from Koreans since I got here: generosity. As I write this, I'm on my second glass of red wine in "Object Café" in the Hongdae area of Seoul, and I've only paid for one of them. I think I earned it for speaking Korean to the other barflies. One of whom, by the way, called me "handsome". Now *that's* generous.

This sort of thing happens to me every other day in Seoul. The service thing, I mean. Not the handsome thing. Wear a smile on your face, look people in the eye when you speak to them and try your darndest to speak their language and they'll move mountains to make you feel comfortable.

You don't normally go to cafés to get free wine, though. The reason I go is usually pretty straightforward: air conditioning. Late July-mid August turns Korea into a sauna.

Every morning, after Korean class (it's going well, by the way) at the Ganada (가나다) Korean Academy, I like to do my homework as quickly as I can so I head to the nearest café, Café Moin (also in Hongdae). By now, they've gotten to know me a little bit and have decided that I need to learn how to say "big size". I still forget, every single time, so I just say, "Ai-su copee juseyo. Big-eu si-ju."

I do my homework, sometimes surrounded by other language students. Often they're Koreans learning how to speak French, aided by a French-speaking expat.

Korea seems to have a curious obsession with France. Many of the most ubiqutious café chains have French names, and serve snacks based on French pastries (usually with a Korean twist, such as red bean paste). Paris Baguette and France Baguette are the two most French-sounding ones, but you'll see French words all over the place.

Another important part of my daily routine is the daily *Oasis* listening session, which normally happens after I've finished my homework but sometimes during.

Your average Korean shop, café, restaurant or bouldering gym will play three songs from *(What's the Story) Morning Glory?* in immediate succession. 100% of the time this mini-playlist will include *Wonderwall*, and then it'll usually also include *Don't Look Back in Anger* and *She's Electric*, but sometimes, to mix it up, *Roll With It*. Sometimes twice.

This normally takes place after homework because that's when I visit my nearest bouldering gym, Astroman. I rarely see anybody in there who isn't Korean, but somehow I managed to buy a month-long membership there which allows me to have my own locker, with my name written on it in Hangul (Korean script).

There aren't many other westerners who visit Astroman, but this means if I want any kind of interaction while I'm there I'm forced to step outside of my comfort zone and speak to a Korean person, which can be pretty terrifying. I know a little bit of Korean, so I think speaking is scarier in case I give the inaccurate impression that I can speak it quite well. I have to try though: why else would I learn except in order to speak to Koreans?

I should mention lunch. Something you learn pretty quickly after landing in Korea is that food is very important to Koreans. I'm not talking the normal, "I need it to survive" kind of important. This is a whole other level of important. Not only do Koreans eat way more food in a single meal than most British people, there's a greeting in Korea which translates to "Have you eaten?"

My favourite lunchtime food, which I do genuinely eat almost every day, is Kimbap. The word "Kimbap" is a combination of the word for "seaweed" (kim) and "rice" (bap). If that sounds like a sushi roll to you, then you'd be thinking how I did when I first saw it - but it's not a sushi roll. First off, kimbap is usually bigger, about 5x bigger than a sushi roll. Secondly, the non-rice element of the contents of a kimbap varies wildly. Ham, vegetables, pork, spam, egg... anything goes, really.

It's also very affordable. The cheapest kimbap I've eaten has been 1,500 won - about 80p - and it was freshly made. The most expensive one was 4,000 won, about £2.20. At a kimbap restaurant you'll normally get side dishes for free as standard, too, such as kimchi, pickled radish and miso soup. When I get kimbap, I never leave hungry and I never leave poor.

The rest of the day is usually either spent recording a new video about Korea for YouTube, blogging, doing a little bit of sightseeing, or -- my new favourite activity -- drumming.

Seoul is full of music practice rooms, usually based in basements or on upper floors of buildings.

-- ASIDE: -- One of the most striking features newcomers usually notice is that Korean retail and service businesses tend to use entire buildings rather than just the bottom floors for their premises. Mixed-use in Korean means *really* mixed-use.
