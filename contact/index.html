		<h2>Work with me</h2>
		<p>If you'd like to work with me, the best place to start would be to email me, at <span class="email-address-placeholder">dan[at]danielhough.co.uk</span>. Alternatively, I'm active on Twitter with the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/basicallydan" target="_blank">@basicallydan</a>.</p>
		<p>I am currently keeping an eye out good freelance positions. My skills and interests are mostly in front-end web development, but I also have plenty of experience in the back-end with C#.NET and a bit of PHP, Ruby and Python. I also have experience developing native mobile applications for iOS. So, if you have any projects that I might be able to help you out with, please get in touch and we can meet up and chat about it.</p>
		<p>I live and work in London, and mostly can be found in Islington and Shoreditch, but I'm more than happy to go elsewhere or work remotely.</p>
		<h3>Teaching &amp; Speaking</h3>
		<p>I'm an amateur public speaker - I've had some speaking engagements on tech, and to demo things I've made, as well as a talk I once gave <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/588647627822308/" target="_blank">about music for gamers</a>, at a meetup called Geeky.</p>
		<p>I'm also a volunteer at Code Club, which has given me some experience teaching children to code in Scratch, so I'm also available for teaching positions.</p>
		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p>I am a licensed London Underground busker with plenty of live music experience, and have written and recorded at least two-dozen acoustic songs using Sony ACID Music and various USB interfaces with microphones. I'm also an experienced vocalist. If you need an example, please check out <a href="http://danplusadd.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">my Bandcamp page</a>. If these skills are somehow helpful to you in your project, then please get in touch.</p>
