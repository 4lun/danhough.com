## Work with me

I keep an open ear for interesting projects from all sorts of places. In general, the best way to contact me is by emailing <span class="email-address-placeholder">dan[at]danhough.com</span>. Alternatively, I'm active on Twitter with the handle [@basicallydan](https://twitter.com/basicallydan).

### Freelance Development

I have 4 years commercial experience developing web-based and mobile software, and I've been making websites for over 15 years. I'm happy at most levels of the application stack doing various things, and I enjoy projects at various sizes. For more information including rates, please see the [freelance page](/freelance).

### Public Speaking

I like to get up in front of audiences and tell them about the things I know, which ranges from API development to front-end dev, as well as non-software topics such as writing and recording music. Here's some stuff I've talked about in the past:

* *API Prototyping* at Skills Matter (02/07/2014)
* *PhoneGap: It's not quite as bad as you think* at Mobilise (06/06/2014)
* *Music for Gamers* at GeekyConf (10/10/2013)
