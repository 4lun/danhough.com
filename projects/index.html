        Like many developers, I tend to have at least a couple of projects going at any one time. In October 2013, I left my full-time job at Huddle in order to pursue a more flexible lifestyle working on these projects and my various hobbies more seriously. Below is a list of various projects I've been involved in. Some of them are ongoing, others are completed or came to a natural end. Lololol.

            <h2>Interfake</h2>
            <h3>Super-simple JSON API Prototyping</h3>
            <p>Interfake came about when a colleague complained about having to constantly create dummy servers while testing an iOS app. Soon, it became a lot more flexible and powerful. It's commonly used in creating API prototypes for nascent projects and for creating mock/dummy APIs for testing. Plus, it's open-source and I'm always looking for new contributors. It's written in NodeJS.</p>

            <h2>SkiFree.js</h2>
            <h3>Web &amp; Mobile Web Game</h3>
            <p>SkiFree was a popular PC Game back in the 90s which came with Microsoft Windows. I created a JavaScript port of it in early 2013, and it became <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5247965">my highest-rated Hacker News submission</a>, and first-ever frontpage entry, too.</p>

            <h2>Code Club</h2>
            <h3>Volunteering with kids</h3>
            <p>Code Club is a nationwide network of weekly after-school clubs run by volunteers to help British Primary School kids to program by teaching them how to make simple games. I volunteer to run one of these clubs. It's great fun and very rewarding. If you're at all experienced with programming, I'd highly recommend it.</p>
