            Like many developers, I tend to have at least a couple of projects going at any one time. In October 2013, I left my full-time job at Huddle in order to pursue a more flexible lifestyle working on these projects and my various hobbies more seriously. Below is a list of various projects I've been involved in. Some of them are ongoing, others are completed or came to a natural end.
