If you are a charitable organisation, and you need some software development work done, then I might (up to a certain extent*) be able to do it free of charge.

If you'd like to talk to me about a project for your charity, please get in touch, including:

* The name of your charity
* The nature of the work your charity does
* Details about the project, and any work that has already taken place as part of it
* Your registered UK charity number, or whatever proof you have for your country.

** * Note: If it's a very large project, I may not be able to help you out for free, but I might be able to do it for a discount. At the very least, however, I can probably advise on where you can start, so get in touch anyway.**
