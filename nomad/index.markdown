# A trip through Asia

Starting in July 2015, I will be taking a nomadic journey through Asia. Starting in **Tokyo, Japan**, and culminating in **Hanoi, Vietnam**, the trip will take me to 9 different countries using at least 5 different modes of transportation: aeroplane, boat, train and tuk-tuk.

At least that's the rough plan. On this page I will keep a high-level intinerary of where I'll be (City, Country) and for how many days, and keep links to related blog posts and other pages.

**What's the purpose of the trip?** I've always been a keen traveler, but since I visited South Korea for the first time in 2010, I fell in love with the place and decided that I had to live there at some point. That's where this idea began. I then decided that I could probably extend the trip and see parts of Asia I've always wanted to see, too.

But while I'm out there I won't just vacationing. I'll continue working on my side projects and try out a few ideas for apps that I've had. I'll be bouldering wherever I can find rocks or a gym to climb. I'll be learning about the places I'm staying and trying to get familiar with the culture. Finally, and not least, I'll be hoping to make some friends on the way.

That's where you, the reader, come in. If you're in any of the places listed in my itinerary, and any of the things I'm saying sound interesting to you, let's meet up and get a drink of coffee, beer, or whatever it is that people drink around here. I'd love to meet you.

## Itinerary

This is a loose, high-level plan. The destination headings in black are confirmed, meaning I've booked stuff and decided to go for certain. Grey headings still may change, but it's part of my plan and probably likely to happen.

### 2 July 2015: Tokyo, Japan

This part is more of a holiday with a couple of friends :smile: we won't be here long, sadly, but I will be in the next destination for ages...

### 8 July 2015: Seoul, Korea

My friends will be joining me here for a week, before they head home. I'll be staying. I'm still looking for accommodation, so please get in touch if you have any ideas.

This is where I'll be staying for the longest time: **89 days**, just a day short of what the Visa waiver allows for British Citizens. I'm quite keen to make some friends here and get to know fellow travellers, people in tech, and anybody else with whom I might get on well :smile:

I'm planning to do a lot of rock climbing - mainly bouldering - while I'm in Korea, with the help of [Korea on the Rocks](http://www.koreaontherocks.com/). If you're into that stuff, I want to hear from you.

I've been before - twice - so I am aware of how much fun this place can be! If you're interested in meeting up, <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Seoul">drop me a line</a>.

### 4 October 2015: Beijing, China

This is where the travel gets a bit more active. I'll be in Beijing only for 4 days before I head to the next destination, but I've been before. Nevertheless, I'd be keen to meet fellow travellers here, so please <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Beijing">email me if you're interested in meeting up</a>.

### 8 October 2015: Pyongyang, DPRK (North Korea)

I'm quite interested in North Korea because it seems more unlike my home country than any other place I've visited. Due to the nature of their Internet access I do not expect anybody reading to be from the DPRK, but anybody else who happens to be taking a trip there at the same time as me, it'd be great to meet! <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Pyongyang">Get in touch</a>.

### 13 October 2015: Qingdao, China

This is a convenient place to stop on the way to the next two destinations, and a nice opportunity to visit the [Tsingtao brewery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsingtao_Brewery). Fancy meeting up? <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Qingdao">Let's grab a drink</a>.

### 14 October 2015: Zhangjiajie, China

This is the nature part of my trip! I'm going here to visit the fantastic-looking [Zhangjiajie National Forest Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiajie_National_Forest_Park) with its unusual rock formations. Fellow ramblers and rock hunters: <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Zhangjiajie">Hit me up</a>.

### 17 October 2015: Shanghai, China

From the scenic tranquility of a rock forest to the world's largest city proper, the two are like yin and yang and I'm sure I'll feel it. I know pretty much nothing about Shanghai, so if you do, I'd love to <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Shanghai">hear from you</a>.

### 19 October 2015: Hong Kong

This is one of the places that most people rave about when I tell them about my trip. I'm here for just under a week, and I understand there's quite a significant tech community in Hong Kong. If you're part of it, please <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Hong+Kong">get in touch</a> and I'll buy you a beer. :smile:

<h3 title="This part of the journey is not yet confirmed" class="unconfirmed">25 October 2015: Bali, Indonesia</h3>

After 3 weeks of near-non-stop travel, Indonesia is my opportunity to relax a bit for about a month. I'll be here to climb, dive, and maybe do some surfing.

At the moment my vague plan is to stay at the Nomad House, but that may change depending on availability.

If you're there, (especially if you're interested in climbing or diving) and you'd like to hang out: <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Bali">Get in touch</a>.

<h3 title="This part of the journey is not yet confirmed" class="unconfirmed">22 November 2015: Singapore</h3>

The final destination in my journey before a three-week-long mad trip, and the last major metropolitan area in the trip. It would be a great place, I think, to meet up with some fellow nomads. <a href="mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=Meet+me+in+Singapore">Drop me a line</a> if you'd like to meet up.

<h3 title="These plans are not yet confirmed" class="unconfirmed">27 November 2015-19 December 2015</h3>

The next few destinations will be far more manic and probably a little more flexible. While I'm interested in meeting up with people in this time, it's going to be harder because travel will be harder to predict. I'll be taking boats, planes, trains, buses and tuk-tuks during this leg of the journey, and I expect it'll be a lot less sitting around with a lot more walking than before. It's going to be very exciting indeed :smile:

* Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam
* Phnom Penh, Cambodia
* Siem Reap, Cambodia,
* Bangkok, Thailand
* Vientiane, Laos
* Luang Prabang, Laos
* Hanoi, Vietnam

## What's next?

Well, I'm back in the UK in time to spend Christmas with my loved ones. But after that, who knows? I might move back to London, I may continue travelling for a while. I already have some destinations in mind if I do, but I may be travelled out by then. We'll see. That's Future Dan in 2016's problem. :wink:

If you're going to be in any of the places I have mentioned above at the same times as me (maybe you're a local, or a fellow traveller) or if you have any advice or ideas of things for me to do, I'd really like to hear from you. Thanks for reading, and happy travels.
