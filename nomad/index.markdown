# A trip through Asia

Starting in July 2015, I will be on a nomadic journey through Asia. Starting in Tokyo, Japan, and culminating in Hanoi, Vietnam, the trip will take me to 9 different countries using at least 5 different modes of transportation: aeroplane, boat, train and tuk-tuk.

At least that's the rough plan. On this page I will keep a high-level intinerary of where I'll be (City, Country) and for how many days, and keep links to related blog posts and other pages.

**What's the purpose of the trip?** I've always been a keen traveler, but since I visited South Korea for the first time in 2010, I fell in love with the place and decided that I had to live there at some point. That's where this idea began. I then decided that I could probably extend the trip and see parts of Asia I've always wanted to see, too.

But while I'm out there I won't just vacationing. I'll continue working on my side projects and try out a few ideas for apps that I've had. I'll be bouldering wherever I can find rocks or a gym to climb. I'll be learning about the places I'm staying and trying to get familiar with the culture. Finally, and not least, I'll be hoping to make some friends on the way.

That's where you, the reader, come in. If you're in any of the places listed in my itinerary, and any of the things I'm saying sound interesting to you, let's meet up and get a drink of coffee, beer, or whatever it is that people drink around here. I'd love to meet you.
