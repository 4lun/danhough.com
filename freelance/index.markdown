## Freelance

I'm a web and mobile developer available for hire, and I enjoy working with individuals as well as small to medium sized organisations to contribute to the success of projects. For more information about me and what I do, see my [CV](/dan-hough-developer-cv-latest.pdf), my [projects page](/projects) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/basicallydan).

### Landing Page

If you're just getting started with your product or company, it can really help to get potential customers engaged as quickly as possible, even if you don't have a working product yet.

I'll create a landing page for you, including information about your product, team and links to social media accounts if you have them. It'll also include, crucially, a sign-up form for future customers to pre-register for your product and receive updates.

This will be built in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and hosted on GitHub pages completely free of charge. Once it's done, I'll hand the reigns over completely to you.

### API Consultancy

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a great way to encourage third parties to interact with the data your business or organisation is in possession of.
