# Freelance Front End & JavaScript Developer

I’ve been freelancing since 2013, and been a professional developer since 2010. In that time I’ve worked for a few great companies and with a lot of great people. Some of them have been kind enough to share some thoughts about how our work went, which you can read here. Alternatively, learn more about me or have a look at my CV.

## Developer for Hire

If you need someone to come into your office and work with the team on your product, **I’m your man**. I specialise in anything to do with **JavaScript on the back end or front end**, and I have a keen eye for **web design as well as development**. I also have experience with iOS applications and the .NET stack.

<blockquote>
First up, Dan is great fun to work with and he has masses of enthusiasm about pretty much anything.  He is knowledgeable about a great deal of web software development, both client side and server side, and also had great input into user experience and usability design of the app he built for us.

</blockquote>

I’m open to all sorts of offers. For me, being an independent developer is about working on **lots of interesting projects**, meeting **great people** and getting **experience** in many fields and technologies. Whatever your situation, budget or goals, get in touch and let’s see if we can work something out.

<blockquote>
Dan was a great addition to our team when we needed him most: in the run up to our iOS app launch. He settled in extremely quickly and got on well with the rest of the team. His work was exceptional and he required little management. We couldn't have been happier!

## Convinced?

I’m **booked up for work until April 2015**, but get in touch anyway if you think I might be the right man for the job. I’m not looking for a permanent role, but if you think you’ve got an interesting job - especially if it involves travelling abroad - please get in touch.

Think we could work together?

## FAQ

### What tools do you use?

While developing I mostly use Sublime Text 3, and I design almost everything that requires design work in Sketch. I often use [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/) for creating design/interaction prototypes, and [Interfake](https://github.com/basicallydan/interfake) for API prototypes.

### What technologies do you use?

Most of the time I build backends with NodeJS, with various libraries like Express, Mongoose and some of [my own stuff](https://github.com/basicallydan/interfake). On the frontend, I'm very familiar with Backbone, Underscore, Knockout and jQuery, but I'm comfortable using most of the main MV* frameworks such as Ember or Angular. For automation I use gulp, or good old fashioned makefiles.

### Are there any kinds of projects you'd prefer?

I'm pretty good at prototypes and MVPs, but I also enjoy what I call "technical debt collection", which involves refactoring an older code into one which is more maintainable, testable and extendable.

### Where are you based?

Right now I'm in London, UK. From July 2015, I'll be in South Korea for a while, then travelling around Asia.

### Will you work remotely?

I'm open to doing work for people from anywhere in the world, and work remotely

### Will you work on-site?

I prefer not to take very long-term on-site jobs, but I'm more than happy to meet in person wherever possible and, if need be, work in your office for a few weeks at a time.

### Are you looking for a permanent job?

I'm interested in relocating to the **United States**, **Canada**, or **South Korea**. If you can sponsor a visa, please [get in touch](mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=I have some overseas work for you).
