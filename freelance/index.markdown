# My Newsletter

I have a newsletter. You can sign up, and it goes out pretty much once a week on Friday afternoon (UK time around 4pm). The contents include stuff I've been reading, listening to or watching over the week, and if I've produced anything of interest it'll be there too.

Check out some [back issues](http://us8.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=fb767a2592dd6490ca38c324b&id=2e88f8cc04) if you need convincing, or just go ahead and sign up:

<form action="//danhough.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=fb767a2592dd6490ca38c324b&amp;id=2e88f8cc04" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate one-line-form small" target="_blank" novalidate>
	<input placeholder="you@domain.com" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" data-segment='{ "name" : "Subscribe Input Clicked", "location" : "Post: {{ page.title }}" }' id="mce-EMAIL">
	<input class="submit-email fa-button cta--secondary square-padding" type="submit" value="Subscribe." data-segment='{ "name" : "Subscribe CTA Clicked", "location" : "Post: {{ page.title }}" }'>
</form>
