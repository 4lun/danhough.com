title: 20% Time, Intrapreneurship and Markdown for the Enterprise

------

Huddle Note is a feature we recently introduced to Huddle which gives users the ability to create lightweight notes within Huddle, which are treated just like any document except for two things. The first is, instead of using a Flexpaper preview, it's previewed using HTML5. The second? In-app editing. You can click a big ol' *Edit* button and edit that note to your heart's content. Plain text? No. HTML? Nope. Markdown. All this in an app aimed at enterprise customers. I'm very proud of what Huddle Note has turned into, and I want to tell the story.

This is a story about how we got Huddle Note from a little prototype side project I spent a couple of days on at work to being a huge new feature which is used by a pretty big chunk of our user base and I hear the Huddle salesfolk talking about every day on the phone to prospects.

## I didn't ask for permission

At Huddle we're fortunate enough to have something similar to Google's 20% time, but we simply call it "Tuesday Time". It's a great initiative: as developers, we can spend every Tuesday working on a personal project. It can be whatever we like as long as it benefits our skills, or Huddle, or the wider development community in some way. Examples include reading books about tech, prototyping new features or volunteering to teach kids or adults about coding.

One week, when I was learning iOS app development, I decided it would be pretty sweet if we had something like Evernote, but for Huddle, since a lot of our customers pick Huddle for our security credentials and sacrifice other apps like Evernote for things like Note-taking. If I could simply make a nice interface for people to create and edit lightweight documents, using the ever-so-flexible Huddle Files API then a note would inherit all the cool stuff that files normally get in Huddle. So, I did it with a basic iPhone version, and it was great! Until, of course, we realised this problem needed a bit more thought.

It was a start, though, and I went to speak to my friend James, a Product Manager, and Jon then-CTO of Huddle.. It turns out they'd been thinking of the exact same thing.

## I had support in the right places

Jon and James were both big fans of the idea since they'd already had it before. The trouble was, Note was quite a disruptive idea. By introducing a new feature like this, we'd risk overloading the feature set of an arguably already very-feature-heavy application. Furthermore, it actually solved problems that Whiteboards already solved, but in a much nicer way. So, it would seem like we'd be shooting ourselves in the foot, so the idea was never tested.

That's what Tuesday Time is for though, so Jon, James and I started working the right angles to get it into the Huddle Roadmap.

## We saw change as an opportunity

## We don't talk about Markdown
