_Notes: Preamble - Should this section be here?_

There are so many image-sharing websites and apps available. According to [a non-exhaustive list of photo-sharing sites on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photo-sharing_websites), the most popular one is Instagra, followed closely by Snapfish, then Flickr, Photobucket.

Most of them require registration, and they have varying levels of storage space available for users. They have different rules about image sizes, permissions, file types, and so on, and depending on what collection of features you put together you may be describing one, many, or none of these services.

What none of them offer, as far as I can tell, is probably one of the most common needs that everyday people have for an image-hosting solution: a convenient, low-overhead way to get loads of photos together from various people in a single collection. You can of course do this with Facebook, or Flickr, or even Dropbox. Just make sure that all of the people involved are registered for the same service, have their accounts connected to one another and that the album in question is unambiguously open for editing by all of the people involved. Easy, right? Of course not.

_Notes: Definitely this first paragraph?_

On my two hands I can't count the number of times, at the end of a festival, holiday, gig, family gathering, or party that everyone has agreed to get their photos together in one place so everyone has access to them, to do with them what they will.

## Picnic

This is where Picnic comes in. Picnic is designed with this specific use case in mind. When I first sat down with George in January to talk it through, I immediately knew what he was talking about, and I was sold. Thus, we began to work on solving this problem for ourselves.

Since then, I've been describing this service to friends and family. In almost all cases, the reaction is, "Wow. Yeah, I'd use that pretty frequently."

### Convenience

Picnic requires no sign-up. To get started, just drop in a few images, wait a few seconds for an album URL, and send it to your friends or family. They go to the page, drop in their images, and you've got your first shared album.

### Ownership

Of course, you can continue to manage your images using just the URL and avoid signing up. But if you *do* sign up using the same computer which you created your album with, ownership of this album will be transferred to your new account. Then you can sign in from any device (Picnic works great on smartphones and tablets - watch this space for a native client!) and manage your albums there without having to remember the URL.

### Portability

Once you've created a collection of images, why would you only want to be able to access them while using Picnic? You can, if you want, slowly go through each page and download the original images to save them to a folder on your computer. Alternatively, for a small fee, Picnic will zip them up for you to download.

### Transparency

Naturally, we have hosting costs. [Like](http://imgur.com/tos#dmca) most services, if you upload images to Picnic then by default you grant Picnic the right to use that image for our own profit. But if that's not your bag, you can opt-out. And if you ask for your images to be deleted, then they _will_ be deleted.

Our prefered method of making money, though, is by adding enough value for users that they're comfortable handing over their hard-earned cash, which is why we have non-free features like downloading collections and increasing storage allocation.

### Simplicity

There's a reason Picnic doesn't do many things. It's because the few things we choose to do, we do them well. Here's a full feature list:

1. Quick drag-and-drop multi-image upload.
2. Upload new images to existing collections.
3. No signup required, but it's easy if you want to.
4. Easy zip download of collections for a small fee.

That's it. Simple. Will we introduce new features with time? It's likely we will. Will they be free? Some of them yes, some of them no, and some of them somewhere in between.
