It's about this time of year that the subject of snowsports comes up, amongst the usual conversations of "What are you doing for Christmas?" and "Finished your Christmas shopping yet?"

Particularly at the UX team table at "Huddle":http://huddle.com, "Mike":http://twitter.com/mikeatherton and "Pete":http://twitter.com/tuptup have somehow ended up on the topic of "SkiFree":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkiFree, a classic PC game originally developed by Chris Pirih and included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows in 1991. For some reason, the main theme of the conversation surrounded whether the abominable snow monster was a robot or a monster.

It was then I knew that the only way to discover the truth was to re-create the game myself using JavaScript. I also did this because I thought it seemed pretty fun.

So, I've started.
