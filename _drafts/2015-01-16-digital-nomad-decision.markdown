title: Becoming a Digital Nomad, Part 1 - The Decision

Last month I set myself a goal to decide in January "what to do with 2015".

2015 had been looming for a while on my consciousness, quietly pointing out that I wasn't getting any younger and that I still hadn't *really* travelled like I'd wanted to do since the first solo trips I took while I was at University. I hadn't really committed myself at any point to the fear and excitement of going to a foreign country, alone, to live there with very little point of reference, and to hop to another when it took my fancy.

2014 was great because it gave me a lot of new opportunities and a chance to reflect. I worked with a lot of great people and I went to a few great places. I learned a huge amount how to run a small business, how to manage my time more effectively and, importantly, a lot about developing different types of software.

2015 had a lot to live up to.

That's why I decided that as I approach the final quarter of my 20s I need to get on with it. Knock this one out of the park, and see if it's "for me" before I become jaded and/or complacement. I'm leaving London to travel for a while.

## The Digital Nomad

As you no doubt have heard, there's a term going around these days which is often applied to people in similar demographics to myself: Digital Nomad.

Like many others I'm in a fortunate enough position that I can do my main hobby, and potentially practice my primary trade, from pretty much anywhere in the world if I want to. It's fairly easy to pick up a laptop and a roaming data SIM, hop on a plane and set up camp in a hotel and do your thing there. This is my intention.

Despite this blasé attitude, I am a cautious man and I do need to plan at least some things. By this point, I've decided "I want to travel". Of course, there's more to it than that.

The first step is deciding where you want to go. I made a list of a few places. I was more granular than this, but broadly speaking:

* South Korea (to live for a while)
* Japan
* USA (everywhere)
* Canada (to live for a while)
* Thailand (to live for a while)
* China
* Vietnam
* Cambodia
* South America (I really know very little about it)
* Czech Republic
* Egypt
* Vanatu (it's a little Island that looks quite nice)

Really, I'd love to visit every city in the world. But I should check them off slowly but surely - set the bar low to start with and then raise it when I gain momentum.

So I chose a few places which were most important to me, and which made sense to be together from a logistical perspective after looking at air fares, train fares and travel times. It looked like this:

1. Go to Japan
2. Go to South Korea
3. Stay in South Korea as long as I can
4. Go to Canada
5. Stay in Canada for a month and a half or so
6. Go to the USA
7. East Coast Road Trip! Or something!
8. Go home for a bit

The reason I ended up with "go home for a bit" at the end is because of Christmas. I like spending Christmas with family. So, after finding out the locations of extended family around Christmas time, I decided the best thing would be to go home then. This hinges, naturally, on when my trip starts.

July the 2nd is about 2 weeks before the lease ends on my flat in London. This seems like as sensible a time to do it as any. This means that the trip will last from 2nd July to some time around Christmas. 5 1/2 months away seems like a good first part to the trip before having some time in more familiar surroundings.

Once I'd decided this, I decided to leave any further travel planning until I'd actually started my trip. Christmas would be a good point to decide whether I wanted to keep going a bit longer or not. Those 5 1/2 months would be a nice taster of the "digital nomad" lifestyle for me to find out whether it's worth continuing for a while.

I had this plan, I knew I wanted to execute on it so it was time to commit somehow. What better way than to put some money down? Once the money has been paid and the tickets are in your inbox, turning back is difficult, and you then know for sure whether you've done what you wanted to do.

With my credit card in hand, I bought a round-trip ticket: Go to Tokyo, then fly to Seoul, then fly back to London... 5 months later. It ended up being considerably cheaper (think ~£1,000) to buy this crazy round trip than to buy individual tickets. All I have to do now is make sure I'm in Seoul in time for my return flight to London. Easy, right?

So, it's happening. It's not a humongously long trip, but it's the longest I've ever taken full stop, let alone the longest I've taken on my own.

What next? Now I have to figure out how I'm going to afford it. More on that in Part 2.

In the meantime, if you're currently living out in Seoul or Canada or anywhere nearby working remotely I'd love to meet up with you when I get to these locations. [Get in touch](dan@danhough.com)!
