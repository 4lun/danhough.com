October 11th was a day of mourning. On any such day, it's appropriate to dress respectfully, so that's what I did.

## "Pickled Leaders Tour"

Kim Il-sung, founder of the WPK and former president of the DPRK, died in 1994. His body was promptly preserved by Soviet embalming experts, the same people who embalmed Stalin and Lenin.

Kim was put into the Kumgungsan Palace of the Sun, in a room maintaining the exact temperature needed to keep his body in perfect condition.

{% include _figure.html src="/img/dprk-part-4/mausoleum-moat.jpg" caption="Not a bad place to be laid to rest. It's surrounded on the north and east (from where we entered) by - seriously - a very wide moat." %}

Seventeen years later, Kim Jong-il, his son, also died. He, too, was embalmed. The palace was redesigned slightly, and a room equal in size to Kim the Elder's was made for Kim the Younger.

Happily, we were all to be treated to a view of both of these men in their lying state. This, we soon learned, would take a very, very long time.

{% include _figure.html src="/img/dprk-part-4/queue.jpg" caption="The never-ending funeral procession of Kim Il-sung continues as foreigners queue up, some for the second or third time." %}

When we arrived we were put into a huge queue. Black limousines with black windows drove by with Russian flags, then more with Indonesian flags. We decided that the Russian and Indonesian delegations had just had their communion with The Kims.

Now it was our turn. Into the cloakroom first - nothing can be taken in. Nothing. No phones, no wallets, no coins. They'd set off the metal detector. I wish I had photos of this part of the tour but sadly, I don't. Cameras weren't allowed. I did find some photos that others have taken online, but I don't know how they managed it.

Next, along a moving walkway to view the "lake" (more moat) which flows around the palace.

Continue: up some stairs, to another moving walkway. This one is thankfully lined not by a moat but by hundreds of photographs of the two leaders. Interesting photographs too. Despite instructions to remain quiet and contemplative, most can't help but make the odd comment.

This walkway was like being part of a real-world Kim Jong-il Looking At Things. Exclusively, it also included a Kim Il-sung Looking At Things, which I don't believe exists on the web. It's much better than KJILAT.

Kim the Elder, in these photos at least, has an air of charisma, authority and relaxedness around him. His son, however, exudes a feeling of boredom, reuctance and spite.

Soon, we're done with the walkway. After a little more queueing, we're finally taken through a small hallway which puffs air at you. The idea is to blow dust off. Then we go into what felt like some kind of an airlock, and finally, into a large, high-ceilinged, darkened room with pillars, very little decoration, and a rectangular-shaped centrepiece surrounded by red velvet ropes.

That centrepiece, as you probably guessed, was Kim Il-sung's body. There he lay, barely touched for 21 years, looking alive-yet-dead. Puffed up cheeks, immaculately-styled hair, covered partially by a blanket. I can't even remember what colour it was - and I can't tell you because naturally we weren't allowed to take photos.

Before we were taken in they explained to us the procedure in this hall: bow once to his right, then again to his left, and then finally, before leaving, to his front. And when I say bow, I mean *bow*. Like, 90Â° if possible.

What I do remember is how much he looked (and I've said this before) like his grandson. In person, that is. I haven't seen a lot of footage of Kim Il-sung movign around, really just photographs. But to be able to compare his face in 3D to that of his grandson's in moving picture furthers my theory that Kim Jong-un is in fact simply a clone of the original leader. \[sic\]

Next, we were to move onto the next room. This involved walking through a vast hall with many large and mysterious doors. We skipped past them, and headed through yet another dust-blower-cum-airlock, into yet another darkened room.

Let me rewind a little: When we were looking at Kim Il-sung, I felt very little in the way of "you were a terrible person". For sure, the first leader was a terrible person and did terrible things, but the crossover between his life and mine wasn't enough for me to take any notice in him. I never heard of him on the news, and rarely do refugees from North Korea talk about his rule. It feels like a long time ago, and it has been over 20 years.

Seeing Kim Jong-il in the flesh, however, was eerie. It roused in me a strange feeling of contempt which I suppose comes from years of negative portrayal in the media, books that I've read and accounts from refugees. Here lay a man whose decisions had led to the suffering of millions, in as recent times as the 21st century. How could the body of such a tyrant be treated with so much reverence? It's a tragedy that the people here either don't know the extent of his cruelty, or can't express it out loud. Nevertheless, it was an interesting sight. I'm glad we got to do this.

After the bodies had both been bowed before, we were taken to see their respective vehicles. They both had different versions of the same Mercedes-Benz, and each had a personal train carriage. Kim Jong-il's carriage sported a very fetching Macbook Pro (you heard it here first, folks: Kim Jong-il was an Apple fan!), but his father's train was much more modest, while still managing to feature nice wooden armchairs with flush leather seats and a large wooden desk.

Allegedly, Kim Jong-il's death occurred while riding in his carriage. Perhaps even while typing out an email on his Macbook. I suppose we'll probably never know.

After our tedious 3-hour Pickled Leaders Tour we were finally released, and driven back into town.

We were finally able to visit Kim Il-sung square, and it was an interesting sight in the aftermath of yesterday's celebrations. Lines all over the streets and road for coordinating movements. It felt a bit like what a festival feels like when it's finished, but there was no litter, somehow.

While here, we visited a shop, and walked by a couple of small food stores with a few customers buying ingredients and snacks - they didn't have much, but they did have a few customers.

{% include _figure.html src="/img/dprk-part-4/kimchi.jpg" caption="Kimchi is loved by North and South Koreans alike, though sadly I suspect in much less supply here in the North." %}

We also visited the foreign-language bookstore, which featured many of the same books available in the previous day's bookstore and gallery, but also some prints and hand-painted art, badges, folk art, and general tourist souvenir fare.

{% include _figure.html src="/img/dprk-part-4/roadside-propaganda.jpg" caption="Some roadside propaganda. I tried to translate the captions of each, but it's pretty hard: On the left, 'Succeed unconditionally until the end.' and on the right 'Advance the banner of the three revolutions' or possibly 'three revolutionary ideas'?" %}

Next, we stopped for a BBQ lunch. Not quite the same as the equivalent in the South but still nice.

Next, it was time for a history lesson! We were taken to the war museum, recently extended in size (by about 100%!) full of modern facilities and sitting next to the famous USS Pueblo.

The Pueblo is a small US "Spy" Ship captured by the North Korean Navy in the 1990s, a fact with they're very keen to make clear to us during the tour of the ship. Bullet holes are outlined and key areas are turned into displays of captured weapons and gear.

Photographs of US Naval Officers writing confessions about their alleged spying activities, as well as the original confession papers themselves, are on display for all to see.

But the propaganda doesn't end there. Next, we're taken into the building of the war museum. Again, no photos here - sorry.

I can describe to you, however, the explicit, full-size models built to depict scenes from the Korean War. US soldiers, either dead or severely wounded, lying in our staggering through a bleak, war-torn landscape. These were fairly real-looking but exaggerated models, whose glass eyes glinted with despair and little plastic guts spewed from their stomachs. We knew it was fake but it was still pretty sickening. This, as far as North Korea is concerned, is a typical scene from the war: defeated, ravaged Americans.

The film came next. I saw some slightly questionable videos about Korean history in South Korea, but this film took stretching the truth to a whole other level.

## Tram

Pyongyang has three forms of public transportation: an underground railroad (the Metro!), a trolleybus system and a tram system. We were told we'd get to use two of them--the metro and the tram--and the tram came first.

In what seemed like an exercise in futility, we drove from the center of the city to the outskirts, at a depot where one of the trams was waiting to take us back into the center of the city. They'd taken it out of service for the day just for us (sorry Pyongyang!!) - apparently it's not so common for tourists to use the tram, and the metro is far more popular. It was nice though. It felt pretty much like any tram system I've ever used that wasn't constructed after the 1990s - kinda clunky, largely made of metal and wood, but quick and smooth enough.

{% include _figure.html src="/img/dprk-part-4/nick-tram.jpg" caption="Sadly, I failed to get a photo of Nick reading the local newspaper the <em>Rodong Sinmun</em> on the tram, since I'd left my copy in the hotel. But here he is on his way to the office on the daily commute anyway." %}

As we made our way through town, it was a rare opportunity to watch the city go by from a relatively low vantage point and much smoother than on the coach. Along the way, we saw our first drunk-and-slightly-disorderly North Korean man walking along the streets. It's a sight which one expects to find in almost any city in the world at least a couple of times, and it was in a strange way quite refreshing to see in Pyongyang. Clearly someone had had a little too much soju to celebrate Party Foundation Day.

Our destination on the tram was a supermarket.

## You never give me your money



I'd already obtained some, which I found lying around (seriously) near the tram depot, but it wasn't a lot. I was keen to get my hands on some real money, and to take it out of the country which again, strictly speaking, is not allowed. Why? Two reasons: first, it's a good souvenir. Secondly, I'm bullish on North Korean Won. It's the currency of the future, so I'm making investments now while it's cheap. \[sic\].

{% include _pull-right.html title="Funny paper" paragraph="Strictly speaking, foreigners aren't allowed to get their hands on the local currency, North Korean Won. The supermarket is one of the few places--the only place on our tour, in fact--where it's possible to exchange US Dollars, Euros, or Chinese Yuan Remnimbi for North Korean Won." text="Won, by the way, is a word used to mark amounts of money. So in Korea when you're being quoted an amount of money, e.g. 300 won, they'll say Sam-baek-won, where Sam-baek is 300 and won is the money. Naturally. What's interesting is when North Korean vendors or cashiers quote prices in Euro or Remnimbi. For 10 Euros, rather than saying Sip-eu-ro, where Sip is 10, they'll say Sip-won-eu-ro. 10won Euro. So it seems that the particle for counting money (won) is used regardless of the currency, but also in place of using the name of the local currency." %}

This supermarket was more like a department store than a supermarket, though, kind of like a Tesco Extra back in the UK. Downstairs were the groceries and a few electronic goods, and upstairs were the clothes.

I grabbed some money, went in and started shopping. I found a mixture of mainly Chinese-produced goods and Korean-produced goods, and even a few of things from Indonesia and Thailand. My objective was to buy some Gochujang (I succeeded!), some Kimchi (I failed) and some kind of North Korean Snack (I bought popcorn). I did also get some North Korean Cola, but sadly it didn't fit my tastebuds quite as well as Coke does.

It was seriously busy at the supermarket today. This was an instance where I suspected that this isn't a usual occurrence, and that perhaps for Foundation Day they'd brought in loads of extra stuff for sale and people were clamouring to stock up on good food. It was really, really busy. But I'm happy to report that North Korean queueing culture is very organised, which pleased me greatly.

Curiously, while I waited in the queue, two young women stood nearby, looking at me. One of them stared *non-stop* for the ten minutes we were waiting in line, with an odd grin on her face, while her friend embarassingly looked away. In this crowd, we tourists were hugely outnumbered by locals, and we stood out like a sore thumb. Most of them obviously were not expecting us, and the novelty was either hilarious or confusing to many of them.

Nevertheless, I found people in the supermarket to be generally helpful and patient. I managed to find the toilet with the help of an old man (the nicest old man I'd come across so far - most of them looked at me scornfully) and the cashier, although looking a little bit tired and fed up, allowed me to fumble with the money for a bit longer than I would've liked.

## Departure Day

October 12th, our final day in North Korea, was a very early start. Rushing to shiny new Pyongyang Airport, we exchanged farewells with new friends and fellow tourists.

The check-in process was surprisingly easy. Although Ms. Li had to do some logistical acrobatics to get me in front of a group of Russian tourists (not sure why this was so important!) the customs officer was friendly and I faced no issues. Nobody checked my camera, nor my phone, nor did they search my hand luggage. I'm sure they had a thorough look in my suitcase using x-ray, but they certainly didn't notice the ~5,000 won I was taking out of the country, apparently "illegally".

In the departure lounge I had a chat with my mum on an international payphone, mostly for the novelty value of it. Foolishly assuming I could pay using the local currency, I failed to pay them and had to borrow money from some friends.

I found the departure lounge really interesting because it was one of the first places I'd seen the word "Keo-pi", which is Konglish/Korean for, you guessed it, "Coffee". It was written above, unsurprisingly, a coffee shop. This felt like a super-modern airport. I looked around, too, but failed to find any portraits of Kim Il-sung or Kim Jong-il.

The airport bookshop also contained loads of the same books we'd found before, as well as some guides to North Korean business, for foreign investors. There are 6 editions so far, each one featuring various industries to which the North Korean government is apparently trying to attract foreign investment. Naturally, one of these is the CNC Machine Industry, one of Korea's most prized and respected industries. So important is this area of business, there's even a song about it.

Right on time, our gate opened and we got on the plane. The slightly rattly flight back to Beijing began, and the North Korean Adventure ended.

When our plane taxied up to the gate in Beijing Airport, our ageing Koryo Air passenger jet ended up sitting right next to one of the sky-blue modern Airbus jets of Korean Air. From the outside it would've been a weirdly contrasting sight: two countries, sharing a name and a history, separated more than any other countries in the world. I wondered whether the Air Koryo and Korean Air crew ever talk to each other in the "Crew Immigration" queue. If so, what do they talk about? How do they greet one another? Have they built up a rapport over the years?

I fear this is a mystery I'll probably never clear up - one of many DPRK-related mysteries.

My fascination with Korea began about 5 years ago when I visited the South for the first time, and after spending more and more time there, and now in the North, my fascination has only grown. I'm confident I'll live to see the day that North Korea becomes a "normal" country, by one way or another, and I'd really like to see the transition as closely as possible.
