## [Down and Out in Paris and London](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paris-London-Penguin-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B002RI9IT2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397846834&sr=8-1&keywords=down+and+out+in+paris+and+london) by George Orwell

* Not at all patronising or looking for sympathy, merely an account of the author's time experiencing poverty and the effect it has on the human spirit
* Very easy read
* Great excerpt: *"I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a begar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, or enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning."*
* Maybe we should all spend a bit more time down-to-earth

## [The Time Machine](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Machine-Enriched-Classics-Pocket-ebook/dp/B00APIJZGC/ref=tmm_kin_title_0) by H.G. Wells

Classic sci-fi from a bygone era which still amazes me and makes my imagination go wild.

## [American Gods](http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Gods-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0755322819) by Neil Gaiman

First ever Gaiman book and I was not disappointed. Really interesting and well-executed idea that I think many have probably explored before, but his attention to detail and use of the "blank slate" character is superb.

## [A Little History of Philosophy] by Nigel Warburton

Very readable and accessible, great for someone with only a very basic level of understanding the history of philosophy and all of it's greatest contributors. Nigel does touch on some of his own opinion at times but in general stays quite unbiased and delivers all the different philosophies of the 40 thinkers features in a way which seems very fair. It would be wise to note also that this is a history of *western* philosophy and doesn't touch on ideas from the east. Great intro to a large and fascinating subject.

[Moonraker] by Ian Fleming

Tense, so much more serious. Really great.

[Superfreakonomics]

Delivered in the same expert storyteller way I expect from the duo. Raises interesting questions but not afraid to cover hard topics which question morality itself. The bit on US healthcare was a bit boring.

[Diamonds are Forever] by Ian Fleming

Not the most action-packed so far, but certainly the one which most represents bond to me. Bond is showing signs of maturing, which is an interesting and welcome feature of the story. The characters are quite interesting, too, and the way that the story is set up (starts out in an African desert, skips to the UK, skips to the US, and then back again) is rather nice. Has some genuinely good twists which really took me by surprise. Really good, very readable. Nice that Fleming leaves out gory details in some parts, which are not necessary for underscoring the cruelty of his captors (weâ€™ve had plenty of that in previous episodes)

[Daemon] by Daniel Suarez

I don't get the ending. I am not sure if there is a moral there except to demonstrate Sobol's remaining humanity - the fact that his avatar at the end is post surgery. Maybe he found some soul in his final days to give humanity a chance to redeem itself.

Anyway, style wise Suarez annoys me a little, making many unnecessary computing references. However, his references, when they are or aren't necessary, are fairly accurate or seem accurate.

A great thing about this story is how it doesn't seem to end on a low note nor a high.

It is complex full of many different characters and is I think a realistic vision of a digital revolution which is unlike the "revolution" which the media portrays.

He plays on many cynicalities of modern society including wars on drugs and terror.

Sometimes its hard to tell whether Suarez is misogynistic or his characters. But not always.

The Great Diffusion!

Very gripping story. Very compelling. Want to see what happens next. I can empathise with protagonists on both sides of the war.

[Terra] by Mitch Benn

Terra is a sweet, comedic tale about an out-of-place human on an alien planet which explores morality and friendship and all those lovely things. It's a little bit teenagery, but a fun read and quite amusing at times. Though some of the jokes a bit too spelled-out. Easy read, too.

[The Birth of Korean Cool] by Euny Hong

Hong's account of Korea's transformation from nigh-on third-world status to global cultural superpower is a fun and interesting tale. She does not sell the country short and does give good justice to a frankly mind-blowing and impressive transformation which has happened in a very short time. However, she comes across rather strongly as being a bit too anti-Japanese at times and a little overly patriotic. Fair enough though, I suppose, given Korea's history of oppression. Hong's explanation of Korea's motivation is *han*, a certain combination of fear and resentment only Koreans can feel, which makes the book come seem sometimes like a very long humblebrag. Nevertheless, very entertaining and full of some interesting information about one of the world's coolest countries.

[From Russia with Love] by Ian Fleming

By far my favourite Bond novel so far. This book is full of premonitions and mystery. It's got everything! Sex, suspicion, adventure, explosions, murder, double-crossing, and a good dose of humour!

Amazing things about this one:

* The moon thing. Days before Bond is attacked by Grant, Fleming makes many references to the three-quarter moon, as if to suggest that the time for Bond's assassination was coming close
* The change from the Russian perspective to Bond's is so sudden and so contrasted, it is amazing that Fleming can write to empathetically with SMERSH. It's beautiful. He doesn't make the Russians out to be cold, kiniving, evil people - he just tells the story as if he were one of them.
* The way Fleming describes Nash is perfect. The whole time, up to the very moment that he turns on Bond, the reader is left wondering whether he is Grant or not. All signs point to yes but it's hard to tell! The name, the build, the hair - but it can't be him, how would the Russians know the code??
* The breakfast is absolutely fantastic
* It ends on such a positive, high note with Bond hilariously fainting.
* Bond is actually quite comical and pathetic in many ways.
* Fleming is so good at describing environments.

This is almost a tale of a man whose life has gone stale, and how his guard gets let down. In fact, Fleming even says that Bond's guard is down before he takes the mission. It was all bound to happen! Bond was *bound* to fall for the trap. Well, he won't again!

[Embassytown] by China Mieville

The plot of this story is complex but well told. It is a drawn-out, detailed novel. The story is astoundingly imaginative, and I'd love to get a glimpse inside the mind of Mieville. But the real meat of this book isn't in the story it tells. It's the ideas that it puts across about the nature of language and how it affects the way that we think and the way we perceive the world.

Some interesting techniques Mieville uses to tell the story which I liked:

* Rather than lots of exposition, details about the universe were slowly eked out in a subtle manner. Terms were introduced and used long before they were explained.
* The dialogue is very realistic. When a character is talking ambiguously because of some context which other characters are part of, they don't make themselves clear in the diaglogue, but the text makes clear what they were saying.

[Dr No] by Ian Fleming

Bonds in for it now! Just as things are starting to get boring for our hero, he's thrown into a life-or-death struggle with quintessential Bond villain, Dr No.

It shows a side of Bond which allows him to sympathise with the "fairer" sex a little more. Not the best story so far but easily the most gripping. To be killed by a pile of dung is also somewhat slapstick for the villain.

The "Bond Girl" in this one is my favourite so far. Self-made, self-taught island woman, very admirable.

This book is the point at which Bond villains and the story become quite far-fetched. That's no bad thing, though. It keeps the story interesting and highlights how Bond's status in the Service is reflected by the level of criminality he has to deal with.

[Goldfinger] by Ian Fleming

Truly Auric Goldfinger is a horrid, despicable man.

Goldfinger's plot is absolutely genius, but the way that Bond and Felix foil it is even better.

The way Bond dismisses his companion's disregard for him as, "she wasn't much into men" is ridiculous! The things he got away with! And of course at the end he "turns" Pussy Galore. Of course he does.

At any rate, the way that this book showcases a bunch of slightly less believable, more pantomime villains. The sort that wouldn't seem out of place in Batman. But I love it! They're full of character and very interesting. Fleming's ability to empathise with villains is one of his strengths: rather than portraying them all as evil, he portrays them mostly as businesspeople or people with less-than-stellar respect for the law.

[For Your Eyes Only]

I found this one a little hard to get into. This strikes me as the most pulp fiction-y of the Bond books so far, because it goes through small, quick stories about Bond and his adventures. However, some of the characters can be quite compelling including the lady in Jamaica whose house is stolen. I love the way she uses a bow and arrow to kill the villain. Really puts Bond in his place!

I also really enjoyed Quantum of Solace. It's unlike other stories. To me it's a story about how people can often end up being much more interesting than one first supposes they are. Important lesson, well told.

[Thunderball] by Ian Fleming

Bond and Felix Leiter take on the secretive and cunning SPECTRE. This story shows signs of Bond's (as well as Leiter's) aging - getting grumpier and more sensitive in his old age.

The stint in Wormwood Scrubs, and the reaction to tourist treatment in Nassau, show off his softer side.

This is an exciting and time-critical story, kind of over-the-top with sea-related adventure at times but I can see how the underwater battle would make for a good scene in a film.
