* Much more haunting than Bladerunner
* Well-written, follows Rick's thoughts quite closely

## [The Aquariams of Pyongyang](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aquariums-Pyongyang-Years-North-Korean/dp/1843544997?tag=daplad-21) by Kang Chol-Hwan

* Animated account of life in a NK Gulag
* Author was one of the lucky ones in many ways - enjoyed a fairly easy life before and after his detention
* Honest and balanced, does not simply cast off the original idea behind the regime as evil and corrupt, but describes the downfall
* Strong message inside about raising awareness and understanding the true challenges of reunification

## [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry-ebook/dp/B0063HC7EQ/ref=sr_1_1?tag=daplad-21)

## [Lie and Let Die: James Bond 007](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-Let-Die-James-Bond-ebook/dp/B008FQBA2I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1397846750&sr=8-2&keywords=LIve+and+Let+Die) by Ian Fleming

* Really likes his breakfast

## [Down and Out in Paris and London](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paris-London-Penguin-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B002RI9IT2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397846834&sr=8-1&keywords=down+and+out+in+paris+and+london) by George Orwell

* An explanation of poverty and homelessness which I hadn't ever had before
* Not at all patronising or looking for sympathy, merely an account of the author's time experiencing poverty and the effect it has on the human spirit
* Very easy read
* Great excerpt: *"I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a begar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, or enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning."*
* Maybe we should all spend a bit more time down-to-earth

## [The Cargo Ship Diaries](http://www.amazon.com/The-Cargo-Ship-Diaries-countries-ebook/dp/B00JDNAQ36) by Niall Doherty

* Actually seems like a nice, honest guy just trying to figure out life
* Has some great ideas and suggestions for how to deal with certain situations on the road
* Easy read, pretty fun and inspiring
* Good for a lazy weekend

## [The Time Machine](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Machine-Enriched-Classics-Pocket-ebook/dp/B00APIJZGC/ref=tmm_kin_title_0) by H.G. Wells

Classic sci-fi from a bygone era which still amazes me and makes my imagination go wild.

## [American Gods](http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Gods-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0755322819) by Neil Gaiman

First ever Gaiman book and I was not disappointed. Really interesting and well-executed idea that I think many have probably explored before, but his attention to detail and use of the "blank slate" character is superb.

## [A Little History of Philosophy] by Nigel Warburton

Very readable and accessible, great for someone with only a very basic level of understanding the history of philosophy and all of it's greatest contributors. Nigel does touch on some of his own opinion at times but in general stays quite unbiased and delivers all the different philosophies of the 40 thinkers features in a way which seems very fair. It would be wise to note also that this is a history of *western* philosophy and doesn't touch on ideas from the east. Great intro to a large and fascinating subject.

[Moonraker] by Ian Fleming

Tense, so much more serious. Really great.

[Superfreakonomics]

Delivered in the same expert storyteller way I expect from the duo. Raises interesting questions but not afraid to cover hard topics which question morality itself. The bit on US healthcare was a bit boring.

[Diamonds are Forever] by Ian Fleming

Not the most action-packed so far, but certainly the one which most represents bond to me. Bond is showing signs of maturing, which is an interesting and welcome feature of the story. The characters are quite interesting, too, and the way that the story is set up (starts out in an African desert, skips to the UK, skips to the US, and then back again) is rather nice. Has some genuinely good twists which really took me by surprise. Really good, very readable. Nice that Fleming leaves out gory details in some parts, which are not necessary for underscoring the cruelty of his captors (weâ€™ve had plenty of that in previous episodes)
