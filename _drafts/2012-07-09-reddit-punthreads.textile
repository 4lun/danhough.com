As a community, Reddit is pretty witty.

Every now and then one comes across a submission on Reddit that either directly or indirectly fuels a huge comment thread full of excellent puns on the topic of the submission, or on some comment which has been made. This is a list of my favourite "Punthreads":http://www.reddit.com/r/punthreads.

bq. They don't want to shoot the 2 pac business model
