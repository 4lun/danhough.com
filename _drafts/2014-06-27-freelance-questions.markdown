So, you've found a potential new client and trying to work out if it's a good fit, and what kind of work you'll be having to do. So far, you know what they want: a web or mobile app. They already have a website and they're ready to expand their offering to their customers by creating some way to use the product or service on the go.

I've put together a checklist of specific questions to ask your client, whether or not you've agreed on a contract. Ideally, do all this beforehand because it may affect what you charge and how long you expect to be working for. But even if it's too late for that, this will save you a lot of trouble. Go through the list, and make sure you ask all the relevant questions before it's too late!

1. Do you have a web API?
2. In which format does your API return data?
3. Have you developed any applications using this API yet?
4. What platform was used to develop the API?
5. What platform was used to develop the existing product?
6. What kind of server is the API running on? (e.g. Heroku, NodeJitsu, VPS, Digital Ocean)
7. Which aspects of the system are timezone-sensitive?
