Recently we launched a [Dev Blog at Huddle](http://tldr.huddle.com/). As one of the two people setting it up (the other was [Emily Skitek](https://github.com/eskitek)) I was super-keen that we should use Jekyll and that we should write using Markdown or Textile. That's what I do for [my blog](https://github.com/basicallydan/Personal-Blog), and it works well for me. I know, it isn't for everyone, but I figured that my fellow developers would like it. I was faced with some opposition, but Emily & I convinced them to give it a go. I was adamant that we should all try writing using Markdown instead of setting up what appeared be the next most popular solution, a heavyweight Wordpress blog with their *lovely* WYSIWYG editor and complex publishing controls. Despite my opposition to the overkill that is Wordpress for such a simple blog, my main point was "look guys, Markdown is cool. Give it a go."

Why, though? Why is writing in Markdown so great for writing? Here's what I think. As always, it's an opinion, you're more than welcome to disagree.

## It's hard to be good at, but it's nigh on impossible to be **bad** at

Because Markdown is based on emergent plain-text email convention, it's pretty intuitive. An asterisk at the start of a line is a bullet point, a bunch of dashes under text (which look like an ad-hoc underline) mean that the text is a header, and so on.

Two line breaks mean paragraph, and one just means line break (well, that depends on your implementation), and there's no chance of accidentally getting craploads of line breaks in between two paragraphs, because renderers will remove that stuff. Put in some URLs? Your render shoudl turn them into a link.

It's something that even if you don't know you're writing it, you can make something readable with. If all you're doing is a few sentences, then two line breaks, then more sentences, and then more line breaks - you've got a nice simple series of paragraphs.

## It's extensible

## You're forced to ignore formatting and focus on content

## It's portable!

## Even the simplest of editors will allow easy editing
