The first cut of my latest app, Pub Crawl: London, is now officially live on the iOS App Store. It's been a few months in the making in mostly spare time, and I'm quite pleased with having finished it, and the way that it looks and works. But if you peek just a little bit under the surface you'll find soon that it's all over the place.

## Direction

When I started this project my goal was to create a simple, single-purpose app which I could sell for a small amount of money which I could legitimately advertise online without feeling like I'm totally wasting my money. I'd never done any kind of online marketing so I was curious about how it worked, and I read a few guides about testing markets quickly. It should cost a throwaway amount, about the same cost as a pint (if not cheaper) that folks on the town might stumble across while preparing for their night out.

I am quite into the London Underground, as much as I hate to use it at times, and I love the simple design principles that go into their maps and signage, so I was inspired by that and thought, *I could just make an app which uses the Tube as a pub crawl route*, meaning I could use all the lovely colours and lines that make the Underground's maps so nice to look at.

## Details

Rather than spending hours designing it I just got straight into it. I pretty quickly came up with what I thought was a pretty nice interaction: an interesting way to navigate an underground line. Simply swiping from one to the next.

I also didn't think long about the name. It does one thing: helps Londoners with their Pub Crawl. So, I simply called it Pub Crawl: London, hoping it would be a good way to make sure it comes up in searches for that exact thing. Descriptive and difficult to misunderstand.
