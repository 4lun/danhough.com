The first cut of my latest app, Pub Crawl: London, is now officially live on the iOS App Store. It's been a few months in the making in mostly spare time, and I'm quite pleased with having finished it, and the way that it looks and works. But if you peek just a little bit under the surface you'll find soon that it's all over the place.

## Direction

When I started this project my goal was to create a simple, single-purpose app which I could sell for a small amount of money which I could legitimately advertise online without feeling like I'm totally wasting my money. I'd never done any kind of online marketing so I was curious about how it worked, and I read a few guides about testing markets quickly. It should cost a throwaway amount, about the same cost as a pint (if not cheaper) that folks on the town might stumble across while preparing for their night out.

I am quite into the London Underground, as much as I hate to use it at times, and I love the simple design principles that go into their maps and signage, so I was inspired by that and thought, *I could just make an app which uses the Tube as a pub crawl route*, meaning I could use all the lovely colours and lines that make the Underground's maps so nice to look at.

## Details

Rather than spending hours designing it I just got straight into it. I pretty quickly came up with what I thought was a pretty nice interaction: an interesting way to navigate an underground line. Simply swiping from one to the next.

I also didn't think long about the name. It does one thing: helps Londoners with their Pub Crawl. So, I simply called it Pub Crawl: London, hoping it would be a good way to make sure it comes up in searches for that exact thing. Descriptive and difficult to misunderstand.

## Determination

It took a few months to get to the point when it was ready to go. As I said, one of the goals was to make some money from this app. After chatting with [Matt](https://twitter.com/MattCowlin) (who's been around this block a few times) about my strategy, I decided it was better to give away the app but sell individual Underground lines for a small fee, and then charge for all of them for a small, but slightly larger fee. 69p for one, Â£1.99 for all of 'em.

This proved to be the hardest part. Apple rejected my application *twice* because of small mistakes I'd made in the way in-app purchases were handled. I was close to giving up at some points, waiting for two weeks to find out if I'd done it right each time, but I stuck with it and finally, they were happy.

## Disappointment

So, after a lot of waiting, the app was finally ready, and finally on the app store. I had a nice landing page set up at http://pubcrawlapp.co.uk explaining what the app is and why you should download it **right now**! Everything was falling into place.

Yet, right now... I don't feel so satisifed. When I look at this thing I've made, I think: what a nice-looking app! That swipe motion is so cool! The home screen is so slick! But it's quickly shadowed by some feelings of dread.

First of all, it lack
