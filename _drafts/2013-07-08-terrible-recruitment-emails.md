As a Software Engineer with any kind of active online presence, and like almost every Software Engineer I know, it's not uncommon for me to recieve unsolicited emails from recruitment consultants working for generic agencies on behalf of well-known, large companies. I don't mind so much, this is what I get for putting my email address online, of course. (Goodness knows where they get my mobile phone number from.)

More often than not, they're huge emails full of as many 'trending' buzzwords and acronyms as possible, lots of apologetic and/or cringeworthy language. It may work for some, but it doesn't work for me nor does it work for most of the people I know. It just puts us off. I've come up with an extreme version of a recruiter email made up of *actual things* I've paraphrased from individual messages.

    Hi Daniel,
    
    Really sorry to contact you out of the blue.

There's your first mistake. Don't start your email with an apology. If you have to apologise for your email, you probably  shouldn't have written it so poorly in the first place.

    My client is looking for a real superstar, right at the top-end, as good if not better than anything they already have in the team.

Two issues here. **Firstly**, "my client" puts me off straight away. It tells me that:

1. You are external, and there's a fair chance you don't know the company very well, would would make you essentially a glorified copy & paste machine.
2. You have some kind of strange deal with the company to stay anonymous in order to keep your commission and stop me from going to them. If they aren't willing to talk to me directly, then I'm not interested.

**Secondly**: "superstar"?? Really?

    How are things going at Huddle? Is everything good? I heard your CTO left recently, hasn't that changed anything?

Naturally, somebody leaving the company who has been there for **five years** is a big loss. However, after five years it's quite a natural thing to be ready to move on for personal reasons. I don't appreciate the overly-personal tone here.
