title: Electric cars are the future whether or not human-induced climate change is real

---

I think electric cars are the future for personal transport, and I'll tell you why: an electric motor can be powered by many more sources of energy than a conventional petrol-powered motor.

Concievably you could have a petrol generator in your electric car which feeds power to the motor, or continually recharges the battery. No problem. But it doesn't work the other way around. Petrol-based motors don't work that way. You can't attach a battery to the motor. It requires tearing out the guts of the car and replacing them with new, shiny, electric guts.

Electric cars are future-proof. Whatever the fuel of the future, you can use that fuel to power your electric cars, as long as that fuel can be used to produce electricity (and it can).

Maybe in the future, we'll have loads of wind power plants. No problem, they can charge your car or your battery. Maybe we'll have solar - again, no problem. Maybe we'll find a huge new source of coal and it'll become crazy cheap to generate electricity from coal again. No problem: indirectly coal-powered cars. It doesn't matter.

Electric cars are **energy production agonistic vehicles**.

Automobile manufacturers are coming around to this, too. Obviously Tesla and Daimler have been at it for years, but mainstream companies are moving in this direction too, so even average Joes and Janes like you and I will be able to buy electric cars soon. Some examples:

* Volvo (Sweden) will build a fully electric car for sale by 2019 and "are confident that by 2020, 10% of Volvo's global sales will be electrified cars".
