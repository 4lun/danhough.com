## Notes

* Can't always be sightseeing
* Gotta work - it just has to be done. Some kind of productivity
* Not as good at being on my own as I thought
* Not as good at sleeping in strange places as I thought
* Not as good at planes as I thought
* Language is hard - pick and choose, you can't learn them all
* Trust is important, but have a backup plan
