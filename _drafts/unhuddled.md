A few months ago, I was sitting in a car being driven by my friend and colleague Dan. The two Dans, driving along the I-10 to Austin, TX for South-by-Southwest. Two Brits in the Land of the Free, eating too much food and going to too many bars, with plenty of time on the road. Obviously, as colleagues, we talked about work.

I complained that I wasn't totally happy with the way my job was going. "On paper," I said, "it's perfect. Good pay, nice benefits, challenging work." Yet, I felt unchallenged. It was then that I said, "Maybe I should just quit. Unemployment is challenging."

We discussed the idea of chucking yourself in the deep end, and seeing if you can swim.
