-- [Me, 9th November 2013](http://danhough.com/blog/unhuddled/)

I admit it: I failed.

...kind of.

Six months ago, I was newly unemployed, fresh from my job at Huddle where I'd learned so much, and made many friends. I was nervous and excited. One night, I published a blog post which struck a chord with hundreds of people and attracted the attention of thousands.

In hindsight, if I had followed the vague, thirteen-word plan I'd hastily typed up that night, I probably would not have had as much fun as I've had in the last six months.

## The Beginning of an Era

Unemployed life was pretty novel at first. On my first day, three separate people sent me a link to that [Mitchell & Webb sketch about working from home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co_DNpTMKXk). I continued to go to my regular social engagements. At the regular movie club I attend most Fridays I was jokingly teased about sitting around doing nothing all day. At early-morning bouldering sessions I had a much more blazé attitude towards finishing up our session at 7:40am as my friends rushed to work and I sauntered back home or to a nearby café with my laptop.

Naturally, though, I didn't spend all my time sitting around, playing computer games and watching crappy daytime TV. I've heard the horror stories and read the advice, so I knew from the beginning that I needed a routine. So, I decided I'd stick to my usual routine: wake up, do some exercise, shower, eat breakfast, get to work, stop at about 6pm. But working solo from home is not at all the same as working in a team, in an office. I had more flexibility because I had nobody to report to, and nobody waiting on me. I had no stand-ups, no retrospectives, no planning meetings, no lunch & learns, and most days, no team lunches (I still visited friends, from time to time).

There were some days I went all day standing up at my desk, programming and speaking to not a soul until my flatmate came home or I went to visit my girlfriend.

It wasn't long, though, before I started running around town chasing potential jobs.

## The Meetings

The moment a software engineer in London makes it public knowledge that they are no longer attached to a particular company, they're going to be inundated with emails from former colleagues, recruiters, and total strangers looking for a work partner. I guarantee it. As flattering and nice as this is it's an unfortunate fact that one only has time for so many jobs, even if most of them are actually genuinely interesting.

I took most meetings, though, thanks to my belief in the power of serendipity and [the importance of opening yourself up to more opportunities (which I've written about)](http://danhough.com/blog/opportunities).

A friend and former employer was very kind to introduce me to three people whom he knew were looking for developers in various ways, and we even got quite far in discussing working together.

In the end, I agreed to work with George at Gojimo (although, they were known as EducationApps then). George is the CEO of the company he founded to help make educational tools and publications more accessible to GCSE and A-Level students. They'd just finished a funding round and were looking for somebody to spruce up their NodeJS backend. Finally, an opportunity to work on some production NodeJS code that was used by a legitimately large number of people.

The three months I spent working part-time at Gojimo was extremely enlightening and fun. I couldn't have asked for a nicer and more welcoming group to do my first self-employed job at.

Despite this, I felt like I'd failed to stick to my plans. I didn't want to be employed yet, I wanted to focus on doing my own thing.

## The Juggling

Thankfully, I was able to get the job done at Gojimo only working three days a week, which left some time to work on my projects. I had one on the backburner which I was keen to get finished and released, which was a spin-off from my first iPhone app, StreetScout.

This project was inspired by the desire to create an iPhone app which used the well-known "page swipe" interaction you may be familiar with - swiping from one screen to the next, to the next, etc, but for the London Underground. I'd also been told many times that StreetScout would be good for planning pub crawls, but I thought that the user experience could be significantly improved.

As well as that, I was very keen to try and make some money with an iPhone app. Hence, the idea for the totally-un-creatively named "Pub Crawl: London" became fully formed. In my spare time I worked on this, and I'm happy to report that it will be released in early June 2014, assuming that Apple are happy to let that happen. I have been posting [updates on Dribbble with interactions, animations and designs on .gif form](https://dribbble.com/basicallydan/buckets/200704-Pub-Crawl-LDN).

I also had a great achievement with one of my side projects: genuine success on GitHub! I've always been a big fan of the open-source community and all the great stuff available thanks to the hard work of people who do it for the love of creation and desire to scratch their own itch, but never made much of a contribution. Being able to create something which solves a real problem and for others to get involved in making the solution even better is extremely satisfying. That is exactly what happened with [Interfake](https://github.com/basicallydan/interfake).
