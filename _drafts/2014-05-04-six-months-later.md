-- [Me, 9th November 2013](http://danhough.com/blog/unhuddled/)

Six months ago, I was newly unemployed, fresh from my job at Huddle where I'd learned so much, and made many friends. I published a blog post which struck a chord with hundreds of people and attracted the attention of thousands, and I was feeling extremely inspired and optimistic about the future.

I promised readers that I'd be spending my time doing things I loved and using my "runway funds" to do so, hopefully turning that into profit. Again with the quote:

> **I'm going to do the things that I enjoy doing, full time**

Did I succeed at that goal? Well, kind of. Let me explain.

## The Paid Work

It wasn't long after publishing my news that I started getting emails and Facebook messages from former colleagues and complete strangers about work that I might be suitable for. This was great, because this is the kind of thing I wanted: I wanted to open myself up to new opportunities which I couldn't pursue whilst in full-time employment.

The trouble with this is that I spent 50% of my time chasing possible jobs that I *might* be interested in when I could've been working on my projects, and I don't think that it had to be this way.

A former boss came to me with three possible jobs: two of which were permanent, one of which was short-term. I like to keep an open mind so I considered all of them. One of them, the short-term one, I went along with. I negotiated a three-days-a-week contract for three months, and got started immediately. This was ideal: the pay was pretty good and I didn't have to dedicate all my time to it, and I'd be learning a lot of new stuff. The job in question was for an early-stage startup whose back-end for their mobile app was build on Express.js, something I had plenty of experience with, but not in production. Now, I do have that experience.

## The Side Projects

In my off-time I continued to work on side projects. One that I started just before I'd left Huddle was inspired by my mobile app StreetScout: A pub crawl app for London, built on top of the Underground network.
