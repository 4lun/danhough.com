-- [Me, 9th November 2013](http://danhough.com/blog/unhuddled/)

Six months ago, I was newly unemployed, fresh from my job at Huddle where I'd learned so much, and made many friends. I was nervous and excited. I published a blog post which struck a chord with hundreds of people and attracted the attention of thousands.

I promised readers that I'd be spending my time doing things I loved and using my "runway funds" to do so, hopefully turning that into profit. Again with the quote:

> **I'm going to do the things that I enjoy doing, full time**

Did I succeed at that goal? Well, kind of. Let me explain.

## The Paid Work

It wasn't long after publishing my news that I started getting emails and Facebook messages from former colleagues and complete strangers about work that I might be suitable for. This was great, because this is the kind of thing I wanted: I wanted to open myself up to new opportunities which I couldn't pursue whilst in full-time employment. But I was bugged my a part of my mind which told me, "you wanted to work for yourself.

Yet, despite the little voice, I got *the fear*. I spent about 50% of my time chasing possible jobs that I *might* be interested in when I could've been working on my projects. I thought, "I should probably get myself some kind of paid work, part-time."

After three or four weeks of this I decided to take an offer I had for a part-time, short term job. We agreed after some negotiation on three days a week for three months, sprucing up a Node.js backend for a mobile app which was due to be re-launched in a big, exciting way towards the end of my three-month contract. I genuinely thought it'd be easy, but it wasn't. Although I worked three days a week, I spent a lot of my time thinking about the work I was doing.

Three days a week may sound like nothing, but in the time I was there it was demanding and high-pressure due to the deadline. I worked late nights a few times, and I feel very much like I got a true startup experience from this. I can tell you for certain though, I didn't work anywhere near as hard or as long as the full-time employees. It was worth it though. Together we refined a great product, and personally I learned a lot. Up until then most of my Node.js experience was very much theoretical - now I was working on production software, and it felt good.

## The Side Projects

In my off-time I continued to work on side projects. One that I started just before I'd left Huddle was inspired by my mobile app StreetScout: A pub crawl app for London, built on top of the Underground network.

The idea was to use this project as an excuse to

1. Try out some interesting interactions which could lend themselves well to the underground and 
2. Learn a whole lot more about iOS development than what I already knew.

Right now, a finished iOS app is sitting in a Git repository waiting to be released. Thanks to input from friends and from strangers, I've refined the idea and decided on a nice, simple montenisation strategy which doesn't offend me and could genuinely work. I'll detail this in a later blog post.

But that isn't
