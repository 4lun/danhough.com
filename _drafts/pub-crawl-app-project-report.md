I started writing Objective-C approximately 13 months ago when I bought my first-ever Apple PC, the MacBook Air (2012) which I'm writing this blog post on. This was soon after buying my first-ever iDevice, the iPhone 4 sitting beside the aforementioned MacBook Air.

## Identifying a Niche

These devices were purchased in order to let me develop my first iOS app, StreetScout, with my colleague Pete O'Grady, at Huddle. Once StreetScout was released, Pete left the project and I took over as the sole developer, and I released version 1.1 earlier this year. In the meantime, at various meetups and in conversations with friends and colleagues one of the many common themes of feedback on StreetScout was that it would be an ideal format for night-time revellers to plan pub/bar crawls. I thought maybe I'll just make that a feature or use it to sell the app in some copy, somewhere. Frankly, though, it would be too much work to mess around StreetScout's UX and architecture to make it work really well for pub crawls.

Instead, I decided that it would be a good exercise in a few new skills to create a new app, from scratch, just for Londoners. I came up with this storybook-style approach to Underground Line navigation and thought it might be a fun learning experience to give it a go.

## Identifying the Lessons

What were the skills to learn, here? I already have about a year of iOS experience, but honestly I don't think it's been quite as varied as I wanted. I used a few controls, and I played with Storyboards, networking, and even a little bit with WebSocket when that's what StreetScout used (seriously!). I've create Table Views, Maps, and messed with Nav Bars... lots of things. But at the end of developing the Pub Crawl app I identified a few things that I've learned.

They aren't just technical skills, though: a big part of this was attempting to learn how to market a mobile app.

## Naming <-- do I need this bit?

The London Pub Crawl app is so named to get straight to the point. I could've called it Pub Crawlr, or LPC, or PubCrawl, or Crawl the Capital, whatever. But that wouldn't be descriptive, and I'm not trying to be creative with the name, here. I'm trying to be creative with the user experience.
