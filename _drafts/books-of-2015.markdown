## Kingsman

## Choose Yourself by James Altucher

While I feel that most "self-help" books tend to be a bit silly and full of lots of contextually-relevant advice and information which the reader generally can't use, Altucher tends to give more broad advice, usually to do with just nudging one in the direction of honesty, positivity and independence about whatever situation one is in. His style is extremely conversational, so pick this up only if you're prepared to find some parts slightly irritating to read.

## Marvel Civil War by Mark Millar

I bought this after I saw an infographic explaining Disney's plans for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and decided it might be an interesting read ahead of the movie(s) currently planned for 2016 as *Captain America: Civil War*. While I wasn't familiar with about 50% of the characters in the book (there are lots of them) this was still a hugely entertaining read and very, very gripping. The art, too, is fantastic.

## Kingsman: Secret Service

A funny but refreshingly old-school take on the British Spy genre, Kingsman made me want to be spy, even more so than my recent obsession with Bond has. It seems more accessible and realistic, yet at the same time completely out there and ridiculous. Really great art, too.

## Look Who's Back by Timur Vermes

When I told my friends I was reading "a book about Hitler" a silence followed, until I explained that the book is about Hitler waking up in 2013 in Berlin with no memory of the previous 60 odd years. It didn't take long for them to get on board. While this is most certainly a comedy, it is also informative and introduced me to some of the other people involved in the Third Reich, and suggested some of the more deluded motivations that they all (including Hitler himself) might've had. Written by a German but translated most excellently by a Brit, this novel has a fun, accessible style. Great read.

## Ms. Marvel: No Normal by G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona

I came across this on Mike Rugnetta's [PBS Idea Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VALaI9HpmUw), and was curious because Ms. Marvel seemed to be somewhat of a departure from some of the characters people are familiar with. This is the story of a young, Muslim, American girl, and her newfound life as a superhero. It's really funny, very self-aware and isn't afraid to include as plot devices what some may deem to be touchy subjects. Yet, Ms. Marvel is not a gimmicky story, and would be an interesting and fun tale regardless of whether the protagonist was Muslim or not. Excellent read!

## The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson

Ronson explains the confusing, vague world of psychiatric disorder classification. The reader gets an interesting and entertaining tour of psychopathy and the many people whom, for better or worse, are involved with the disorder.

## On Her Majesty's Secret Service by Ian Fleming

Finally Bond really shows his vulnerable side, exposes himself and gets beaten and bruised in the process, only for it to all fall apart. One of the saddest, so far.

## You Only Live Twice by Ian Fleming

I'm fairly sure this book is largely responsible for popularising many of the probable myths and stereotypes that most of the western world holds about Japan. Nevertheless, this is an entertaining novel which is lighter on the misogyny than previous stories. It's the Bond equivalent of a mid-life crisis, clearly written towards the end of Fleming's career as the author of 007 novels.

## Batman: The Dark Knight Returns

We all know the dark Batman stories of the silver screen, but this Frank Miller take on the Dark Knight takes it to a whole new level. In this story (which provides the basis Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice) we follow an old, bored Bruce Wayne as he takes up the job he retired from years ago. Chilling stuff!

## The Man with the Golden Gun by Ian Fleming

## Octopussy and the Living Daylights by Ian Fleming

## Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift

## A Kim Jong-Il Production by Paul Fischer

## Dear Leader by Jang Jin-Sung

## Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman
