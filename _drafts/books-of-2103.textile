This Christmas I've received a Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas, and I'm very excited to finish off a lot of existing reads and starting some new ones in 2013.

But 2012 was a reasonably busy year for reading for me. For my own memory, and in case anybody is looking for recommendations, here are some 140-character-or-less reviews/synopses of the books I can remember reading. :)

h3. Feed: Book 1 of the Newsflesh Trilogy by Mira Grant

h3. The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne

h3. Batman Year One by David Mazucchelli

h3. The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window And Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson
