#### How did you get into North Korea?

It's actually very easy, but it's a little more expensive than most 4-day holidays in Asia. You need to get in touch with a company such as Koryo or Young Pioneers, and sign up for one of their group tours. They'll handle the rest of it, *except* for your ticket to Beijing. You just need to make sure you're in Beijing at the right time, and they can advise on getting a Chinese visa.

#### But I'm American, they hate Americans! They'll never let me in.

They don't hate Americans, and they will let you in.

#### But I'm a journalist!

Okay you may have trouble.

#### But I'm South Korean!

If you can get citizenship for some other country somehow, you'll be fine. But sorry, you can't typically enter North Korea on a South Korean passport.

#### Why did you go to North Korea?

Ever since I first visited South Korea in 2010 I've been interested in the country. I learned more and more through accounts by defectors and journalists and decided that I wanted to see for myself what it's like.

#### But you're seeing only what they want you to see!

I'm well aware of that, but they can only orchestrate so many things. It's not hard to look behind the curtain a little bit, and if you can get to talking to some people it won't take long to appreciate the individuality of the people you're meeting.

#### Don't you feel bad for pumping money into the brutal North Korean regime?

No. The country isn't going to get anywhere if we just ignore it. Some of the money I spent there will go straight into the pockets of the people I gave it to, and they can use that to improve their lives and the lives of their families. North Korea is just waking up to capitalism, and tourism is actually a very small part of it.

#### Did you see Kim Jong-un?

No.

#### Did you see the Moranbong band?

No, but I saw the new Chongbong band. You can read about that in [part 4](/blog/dprk-part-4).

#### Did you eat dog?

No, but we were offered dog soup. I declined.

#### Did you try North Korean soju?

Yes! I tried two brands: the first one, Pyongyang Soju, was very pleasant. It cost about 300 Chinese Yuan. The second I don't remember the name of, but it cost only 80 Chinese Yuan and it tasted like paint thinner.

#### Did you try North Korean beer?

Yes! I had some Taedong beer - they had a light variety and a dark variety. I preferred the dark, but both were very pleasant.

#### Did you make any North Korean friends?

I like to think so, but it's very possible that my friend will forget me as he probably meets many tourists - but I don't mind!

#### Will you go back?

Yes, I do intend to return.

#### What language do they speak in North Korea?

Korean of course! But it's a slightly different dialect from what is spoken in the South. It's not hard to switch between the two, but many words don't officially exist in the North. Nevertheless, lots of people are familiar with Southern words because it's quite usual to consume South Korean media.

#### Were you brainwashed?

No, I wasn't brainwashed. As far as I know.

#### Do they have the Internet in North Korea?

No, not as we know it. They have an *intranet*, which has its own little web on it. I didn't get to use it, but I asked a couple of people about it. There are messaging and photo sharing apps, as well as some proprietary websites for various departments to use, and they have their own email systems.

The vast majority of North Koreans do not get to use the world-wide Internet, but the foreign guides from Koryo (and probably from other overseas tour companies) were able to use a 3G network for a couple of hours each day which connected to the global Internet.

#### So, they have mobile phones?

Yes! Mobile phones and even smartphones are very popular in Pyongyang and increasingly popular outside of the capital. The most recent figure reports over 2.5 million subscriptions to the nationwide *Koryolink* network.

#### Can North Koreans travel abroad?

Some can, yes! When I was in Beijing airport, there were a few waiting for the same plane as us. Usually only businesspeople, diplomats and high-ranking party officials or members of the Kim family can travel abroad. Sometimes entertainers, sportspeople and artists are also allowed. However, your average North Korean will probably not travel abroad any time soon.

Some, especially in the Northern provinces, will cross the Yalu river into China in order to smuggle in goods, which means they are going abroad and then returning.

#### Did you say businesspeople? But North Korea is a self-reliant communist state! Why would they have businesspeople?

Actually, North Korea isn't strictly speaking communist. They have plenty of private businesses these days, some of which are actually *legitimate*. Others exist thanks to corruption and bribes, and some are private-public ventures. These are the ones which are more likely to have business overseas, mostly with China and Russia. There are other countries however: the *Koryolink* network, for instance, is 75% owned by an Egyptian telecoms operator OTMT, with 25% owned by the DPRK. In fact, you can buy shares in this company on the Egyptian stock exchange or the UK stock exchange. Don't expect a huge return from North Korea though, as apparently they haven't returned any of the hefty profits to Egyptian shareholders yet after 5 years.

The word "communist" isn't even used in official rhetoric anymore. These days they use the word "socialist" and "Juche", which is the official ideology, a bastardised Marxism which few truly put at the top of their list of priorities these days.

#### Are North Korean people really as short and thin as we're led to believe?

Sadly, most people in North Korea were considerably shorter and skinnier than their counterparts in South Korea, yes. I saw very few people close to being "overweight". In the 1990s, North Korea had a terrible famine which wiped out a huge chunk of the population and inevitably stunted the growth of millions. These days, things are better but most people outside of Pyongyang and many inside still live hand-to-mouth. That doesn't mean you should go around handing out food when you visit, but make sure you're grateful for the food that you're given, and bringing some small food-based gifts along for your guides wouldn't hurt either.

#### When you arrived, did they go through your computer?

A little. An immigration officer asked to see what movies I had on my laptop to make sure there wasn't anything from South Korea. I just opened my *Movies* folder. He saw a copy of an old James Bond movie and exclaimed with delight, "Oh! James Bond!" That was all. I could've easily smuggled anything in on a MicroSD card if I'd wanted to.

#### Did they search your camera as you left? Or at all?

Not once was my camera confiscated or searched, and it was almost always with me. I also didn't lose any photos.
