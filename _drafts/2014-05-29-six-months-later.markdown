I admit it: I failed.

...kind of.

Six months ago, I was newly unemployed, fresh from my job at Huddle where I'd learned so much, and made many friends. I was nervous and excited. One night, I published a blog post which struck a chord with hundreds of people and attracted the attention of thousands.

I started writing an epic tale detailing everything I've been doing since then, but I realised that it was becoming long, and droning, and taking me far too long to publish. So, here I am getting it done. Rather than writing a story about what I've been up to, I'm going to share with you some snippets of what has been going on. If there's demand for more detail, I will provide.

## How I failed

I haven't been unemployed for the last six months and sadly, I didn't end up doing what I enjoyed full-time. I've been self-employed, working for paying clients. I've had two software contracts with different startups and now I'm starting another.

One might say that this is still stuff I enjoy. It is, to an extent. Yes, I enjoy writing software and yes, I've enjoyed working for the clients I've worked for. But that wasn't what I had in mind when I said what I said back in November 2013.

## Things don't have to be black or white

Being hired or employed doesn't mean having to fall back into the same routines as before and working the same hours as before. It also doesn't necessarily mean staying in the same place.

I looked for jobs which gave me freedom to work where and how I like, and gave me a lot of flexibility and free time. The contract positions I've had have either been 3 days or 4 days a week, which has done wonders for my productivity on my own projects.

My second job, with a startup called upmysport, also happened to be based in Chamonix, in France. Chamonix is a ski resort, and thankfully I was there over the winter months and got a *lot* of snowboarding in.

## More responsibility is a good thing and a bad thing

There are now a lot more things that, as a self-employed person in the UK, I need to do. I need to file my own tax return, for example, and keep my own tax reserve. I can't just receive a paycheck and know for sure that all that money is mine.

I actually like this part of it. I like knowing where my money is going, and how I can legitimately pay fewer taxes because the things I've bought have contributed towards my business as a software engineer.

There are some problems with this, however. I'm on my own now in so many ways. Now, when I'm stuck with a problem I can't typically turn around and ask a colleague to drop everything and help me.

I can't have things bought for me anymore, such as conference tickets and software licences. All of my expenses are *my* expenses, so the opportunity cost when buying things is a lot higher.

## Negotiation isn't as awkward as it looks

Now that any work I do is paid with invoices instead of as a salary, I can choose my own rates. At first, I thought it'd be difficult to do this.
