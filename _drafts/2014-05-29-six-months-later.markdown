I admit it: I failed.

...kind of.

Six months ago, I was newly unemployed, fresh from my job at Huddle where I'd learned so much, and made many friends. I was nervous and excited. One night, I published a blog post which struck a chord with hundreds of people and attracted the attention of thousands.

I've been writing this post for a month but it was becoming long and boring. So, here I am getting it done in simpler terms. Rather than writing all about what I've been up to, I'm going to share with you some snippets of what has been going on and what I've learned. If there's demand for more detail, I will provide.

## How I failed

Confession: I haven't been unemployed for the last six months and sadly, I didn't strictly end up doing what I enjoyed full-time. I've been self-employed, working for paying clients. I've had two software contracts with different startups and now I'm starting another.

You might say that this is still stuff I enjoy, and you'd be right. Yes, I enjoy writing software and yes, I've enjoyed working for the clients I've worked for. But that wasn't what I had in mind when I said what I said back in November 2013. So, I consider this a failure, but that doesn't mean it's been a negative experience; far from it, in fact.

## Things don't have to be black or white

Being hired or employed doesn't mean having to fall back into the same routines as before and working the same hours as before. It also doesn't necessarily mean staying in the same place.

I've manuveured myself into jobs which gave me freedom to work where and how I like, with a lot of flexibility and free time. The contract positions I've had have either been 3 days or 4 days a week, which has done wonders for my productivity on my own projects and hobbies.

My second job, with a startup called upmysport, also happened to be based in Chamonix, in France. Chamonix is a ski resort. I was there over the winter months and got a *lot* of snowboarding in.

It wasn't all fun and games, though.

## More responsibility is a good thing and a bad thing

There are now a lot more things that, as a self-employed person in the UK, I need to do. I need to file my own tax return, for example, and keep my own tax reserve. I can't just receive a paycheck and know for sure that all that money is mine.

I actually like this part of it. I like knowing where my money is going, and how I can legitimately pay fewer taxes because the things I've bought have contributed towards my business as a software engineer.

There are some problems with this, however. I'm on my own now in so many more ways. Now, when I'm stuck with a problem I can't typically turn around and ask a colleague to drop everything and help me.

I can't have things bought for me anymore, such as conference tickets and software licences. All of my expenses are *my* expenses, so the opportunity cost when buying things is a lot higher.

I don't get company lunches anymore, or health insurance, or paid holidays, or nights out with the company card behind the bar.

However, the responsibility of being in charge of my own income and my own time (to a much greater extent, anyway) outweighs all of that.

## Price negotiation isn't as bad as it looks

Now that any work I do is paid with invoices instead of as a salary, I can choose my own rates. At first, I thought it'd be difficult to do this. The truth is, if you're up front about what you're doing ("I'm looking for a short term contract") it's a lot easier to let go of your inhibitions and be honest about what you think you're worth.

Tell someone what you're willing to work for. If they accept, great! If not, they may have a lower offer. A lot of advice says to only accept jobs which are willing to pay the rate that you're offering, but I find that this rarely works in practice. Look at each job individually and you may find that you can gain more from a lower-paying job than a higher-paying job, in non-monetary terms.

For instance, one of the jobs I accepted in the last 6 months I took for well below the rate that one should expect in London, but the location was at a Ski resort, and they were extremely helpful in terms of getting me settled in.

Plus, there's something to be said for the feeling of creating an invoice and sending it off to a client. There's something very empowering about that.

## The grass is still greener, sometimes

One of the general lessons I've learned is that the grass usually is greener at some point or another, regardless of the situation. Full-time employment has it's perks, and sometimes, especially when talking to my former colleagues, I look back on those perks and feel a little bit of sadness that I don't get to enjoy them, too.

## I made the right choice

I may not have totally succeeded with my initial goal (yet!) but I know that I've done the right thing. The time I've spent being self-employed has been enlightening, exciting, and *very* freeing.

Since I was a boy I've always been striving for more independence, and the move I made to leave full-time employment has given me that in a number of ways.

I've gained a greater understanding of my finances, gained a better feel for running a business, and understood what it's like not to have a regular, consistent paycheck coming in.

I've represented *myself* on stages and at meetups, made decisions which formerly I would've asked of someone else, and I've been approached for advice by strangers.

I'm not saying that I'll rule out full-time employment in the future - I'm always keeping an eye open for the company of my dreams - but for now I'm very glad of the decision I made, and I'd recommend it to anybody who has become disenchanted with their job.

## So, what about the projects?

This blog post wouldn't be complete without a peek into what I've done with my free time during the last few months. I've done a lot of little things here and there and I'm very proud of what I've achieved.
