title: How To Funemployment
--------

Recently I blogged about how I quit my job in order to move toward a life of greater independence, spending time working on projects that I'm more passonate about than what I was doing in my job.

I received a tonne of feedback but also a few questions about how I prepared to jump straight into a life of unemployment, free of the forced scheduled and conveniently always-available social interactions.

This blog post will explain a few of the things I did in preparation, and some of the rules I have been sticking to to help keep me sane.

## 1. Put some money aside

// Stuff here about how to decide how much you need and how to prioritize a few things

## 2. Buy lots of dry, non-perishable food. No, more than that.

// Talk about how useful dry food can be.

## 3. Talk to people close to you about it

## 4. Make some rules

// Arbitrary rules which help establish order

## 5. Meetups, meetups, meetups!
