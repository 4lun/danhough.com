title: The Broken Parts of the Consumer Web
---

These days, I read so, so, so many articles about "putting the user first" in software UX. It seems like by now we should be reading from the same hymn sheet, and yet when that inevitable time comes around that one must search for a new flat, one is bombarded by one of the most frustrating and horribly unfair, 

* Point out that gumtree is broke
* Point out how shitty spareroom is
* Point out zoopla being unfair

* Why can't we choose discrete values of prices?
* Why can't we search just for private landlords?
* Why are agencies allowed to spam these sites?
* Why are we not allowed to search based on whether a room has a living room or not?
