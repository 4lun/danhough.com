October 10th: The big day. This is the day that the whole of North Korea has been waiting and preparing for. Party Foundation Day. It's been 70 years since the Workers Party of Korea (WPK) was formed.

The capital, Pyongyang, is filled with tourists and delegations. Over the past couple of days our tour group, with Koryo Tours, had been told that we "may or may not" be able to attend the huge parade which was planned to take place in Kim Il-sung Square, but one thing was for certain: we'd get to see some flowers.

## Bookshop

## Water Park

As we had all expected, we were soon told that we would not be allowed to go to the parade. It had been suggested a few times before. We were also told that in fact, the parade would be delayed anyway because of poor weather conditions. It was true: the clouds overhead were haunting and would definitely put a downer on the day's festivities. Maybe China will step in with their anti-cloud rockets? The tourists' imaginations, free from the reality anchor of the Internet, were obviously running wilder than usual.

However, that didn't slow us down much. KITC (Korean International Tourism Company) took us to a recently-opened waterpark/leisure center.

As we entered, we were quickly warned not to take any photos of what we were about to see. Then I came up against a terrifying vision: An upright, jolly-looking, green-camo-jumpsuit-wearing, larger-than-life Kim Jong-il. He was standing there, greeting guests to the waterpark as he stood in front of a beautiful painting of the Korean countryside with Paekdusan (the special mountain) making a central appearance.

This statue of Kim the Younger was so accurate it could easily have been taken right out of Madame Tussauds - except that it was much, much larger than he was. It wasn't meant to exaggerate his height or anything, it was simply scaled up. But everything else about it--the dimensions, the colours, the expression on the face--was life-like. Life-like, of course, in the photoshopped sense. Kim rarely smiled so broadly, or stood up so straight. It was a cariacature of him, but a realistic one, nonetheless.

It was times like this when I wished I'd had a hidden camera. So, we passed by without taking any photos. We just gasped, quietly, and shuddered.

The pool was huge. Not a pool for doing laps in, more one for messing around in. It was mostly filled with families playing, and apparently it would've been OK for us to go for a swim, but unsurprisingly nobody was keen to buy the speedos they had on sale and take a dip with the Koreans. Partly out of fear of weirding out the locals, partly out of fear of speedos.

Instead, we were served our lunch. This was hugely exciting for me because our lunch was one of my favourite Korean meals - the classic Korean packed lunch, in fact: Kimbap! It was quite a basic one, not much in it: just some rice, carrot, dried cucumber and a little bit of omelete. Still tasty though.

Rishi and I managed to order some draught beer too. This was neither the first nor the last time that speaking Korean would get us something a little bit extra on top of what we were already getting. Until now, we'd really only been drinking bottles. And boy, was the draught good.

We enjoyed our lunch, and enjoyed watching Koreans splash about in the pool and speed down the slide. Some went for coffee, others played billiards, and others explored the pool areas, inside and out.

As we waited, our situation was explained to us in disjointed parts and the picture soon became clear. The tourists, for some reason, were being kept away from the parade preparation. The general feeling was that because the roads were so busy, it would be disruptive for us to be taken around in our big tour coaches.

Eventually, however, they got us back onto the buses. Quickly, too, there was no time to waste.
