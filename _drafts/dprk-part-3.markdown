October 10th: The big day. This is the day that the whole of North Korea has been waiting and preparing for. Party Foundation Day. It's been 70 years since the Workers Party of Korea (WPK) was formed.

The capital, Pyongyang, is filled with tourists and delegations. Over the past couple of days our tour group, with Koryo Tours, had been told that we "may or may not" be able to attend the huge parade which was planned to take place in Kim Il-sung Square, but one thing was for certain: we'd get to see some flowers.

## Flowers

In North Korea there are two famous flowers: Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia.  They're both flowered developed by botanists in Indonesia, apparently as a gift from the Indonesian president to the two Kims - they feature quite frequently in paintings, videos, and generally in fancy buildings which are liable to have flowers.

This morning while we waited for the parade to happen (and to find out if we'd see it or not) we were to see a flower exhibit. Throughout the country, various groups such as governmental departments, regional governments, trade organisations, and even the tour company taking us around (Korea International Tourism Company or KITC) had made huge arrangements of these two flowers in honour of the leaders.

To be honest, there's not a whole lot to be said about this exhibit. It was impressive, to be sure, but most of what I can say about it is best told through photographs.

One interesting thing which happened at the exhibit was when I asked one of my tour guides what the name of the traditional Korean dress is. In South Korea, it's called Hanok. Most traditional things in South Korea start with Han. Unsurprisingly, the North Korean dialect calls traditional clothes Choson-ot. There we see the familiar prefix "Choson" which I mentioned in a previous post about the name of the country and of the alphabet.

After signing the guest book and thanking the staff for showing us the flowers and explaining their meaning, we headed off. Still plenty to do to fill the time before the parade. We were going to see one of Pyongyang's greatest monuments!

## Hard work, with a dash of artistry

Most people are familiar with the hammer and sickle which appears in so much communist iconography. The Soviets used it, the Chinese Communists used it, as did those in Vietnam, Cambodia, Cuba. All over the place. Often it represents the *party*, rather than the *country*, in a communist state. In Korea, this is true. But in Korea, the party logo includes not only the hammer and sickle, but a a brush, in between the two aggressive symbols of industry and agriculture. The brush symbolises art and culture, thought to be very important by the Workers Party of Korea. In fact, art in the form of cinema was a huge part of Kim Jong-il's plans to make North Korea a respected force on the world stage (at this, he failed).

This iconography, being of three parts, is easily adapted to suit a three-dimensional model. That is quickly apparent in the Workers Party Monument, recently refurbished, sitting on the other side of the river from but facing the Mansudae statues.

We were shown this impressive structure by a middle-aged lady in a Choson-ot. In South Korea, she probably would've been an ajumma - but here she was a kindly lady with a very, very polite accent who had a deep respect for this monument and the huge amount of work put into it.

But our stop here did not last long. We were taken towards a building which we were told contains a photo gallery and bookshop. But on the way we stopped in a small statue shop where, in an attached sitting room, an old Korean man was explaining, in English, something about the war. I became quite captivated by his lecture and after about 5 minutes realised my entire tour group had gone. I was now hanging out with a different group. All people I'd never met.

After panicking for a few seconds I realised that I was unsupervised for the first time. So, I was excited. I wandered around for a minute, looked at the monument again on my own and went behind an open door that probably wasn't meant for me (it was a supply closet, sorry). Soon, though, boredom overtook curiosity and I went to what looked like it was probably the entrance to the aforementioned gallery and bookshop. Luckily, it was. There was plenty of good art - not all party-related. But the most fascinating thing was the literature and DVDs available.

Best-sellers such as *On Enhancing the Party's Role* by Kim Jong-il, *Let us learn Korean* by Anonymous and, my favourite, *Let us give a strong impetus to the three revolutions and effect a fresh advance in production*, also by Kim Jong-il, were available at this store. Also available here on DVD were hit children's made-for-TV movies *The Youngest Bear* and *Two Friends Drink Mineral Water*.

Of course, most of these books weren't books, but transcripts of the leaders' speeches: they were tiny little books to carry around and remind you of the current or past objective of the party. There were plenty by Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, too.

{% include _pull-right.html title="Socialist Fairlyland" paragraph="Many tourists bought multiple books and DVDs. The party is most certainly aware of the quirkiness of these items, of that I am sure. One needs only travel to China (as many top-ranking Koreans often do) to know that these sorts of things are not generally available to Westerners. Therein lies what Kim Jong-un believes is the solution to Korea's financial woes: He wants to turn the place into \"socialist fairlyland\"." text="It's very clear that the North Korean government understands much of the allure for tourists. Most aren't interested in learning more about feudal Korea, the Joseon dynasty or 16th-century naval battles with Japan. Most are interested in visiting a bonafide totalitarian communist state, locked in a 1980s time bubble. That's why Kim Jong-un recently declared that he wishes to transform the state into a \"socialist fairyland\" and boost tourist numbers up to 1,000,000 each year. Only time will tell if this is a good idea." %}

## Water Park

As we had all expected, we were soon told that we would not be allowed to go to the parade. It had been suggested a few times before. We were also told that in fact, the parade would be delayed anyway because of poor weather conditions. It was true: the clouds overhead were haunting and would definitely put a downer on the day's festivities. Maybe China will step in with their anti-cloud rockets? The tourists' imaginations, free from the reality anchor of the Internet, were obviously running wilder than usual.

However, that didn't slow us down much. KITC (Korean International Tourism Company) took us to a recently-opened waterpark/leisure center.

As we entered, we were quickly warned not to take any photos of what we were about to see. Then I came up against a terrifying vision: An upright, jolly-looking, green-camo-jumpsuit-wearing, larger-than-life Kim Jong-il. He was standing there, greeting guests to the waterpark as he stood in front of a beautiful painting of the Korean countryside with Paekdusan (the special mountain) making a central appearance.

This statue of Kim the Younger was so accurate it could easily have been taken right out of Madame Tussauds - except that it was much, much larger than he was. It wasn't meant to exaggerate his height or anything, it was simply scaled up. But everything else about it--the dimensions, the colours, the expression on the face--was life-like. Life-like, of course, in the photoshopped sense. Kim rarely smiled so broadly, or stood up so straight. It was a cariacature of him, but a realistic one, nonetheless.

It was times like this when I wished I'd had a hidden camera. So, we passed by without taking any photos. We just gasped, quietly, and shuddered.

The pool was huge. Not a pool for doing laps in, more one for messing around in. It was mostly filled with families playing, and apparently it would've been OK for us to go for a swim, but unsurprisingly nobody was keen to buy the speedos they had on sale and take a dip with the Koreans. Partly out of fear of weirding out the locals, partly out of fear of speedos.

Instead, we were served our lunch. This was hugely exciting for me because our lunch was one of my favourite Korean meals - the classic Korean packed lunch, in fact: Kimbap! It was quite a basic one, not much in it: just some rice, carrot, dried cucumber and a little bit of omelete. Still tasty though.

Rishi and I managed to order some draught beer too. This was neither the first nor the last time that speaking Korean would get us something a little bit extra on top of what we were already getting. Until now, we'd really only been drinking bottles. And boy, was the draught good.

We enjoyed our lunch, and enjoyed watching Koreans splash about in the pool and speed down the slide. Some went for coffee, others played billiards, and others explored the pool areas, inside and out.

As we waited, our situation was explained to us in disjointed parts and the picture soon became clear. The tourists, for some reason, were being kept away from the parade preparation. The general feeling was that because the roads were so busy, it would be disruptive for us to be taken around in our big tour coaches.

Eventually, however, they got us back onto the buses. Quickly, too, there was no time to waste.

---

We were taken to the side of the Taedong river opposite to Kim Il-sung square, where the parade would be taking place. This is where thousands of soldiers would pass through and stand, and Kim Jong-un would stand later with his wife, family (those whom he hadn't exiled or executed) and close political allies to address the crowd.

At the waterfront of the river, we looked towards the square. Nothing happened. All was quiet. We were waiting for some kind of cannon fire or planes to fly over us. The clouds had miraculously cleared, though, so it was looking good.

After half an hour of inactivity, things started to get a bit more exciting. Huge crowds of children wearing red caps and scarves started walking by our viewing point and across the bridge. To our surprise, there were a fair few Koreans walking around in the park near our viewing point, rather than attending the parade on the sidelines. I suspect space was limited, and just like us, not everybody could attend.

Eventually, we heard some loud cannon fire - I don't remember how much, but it wasn't a lot. And soon, fighter jets flew over spewing out coloured smoke, reminicent of the Red Arrows back in the UK. Propellor planes also turend up, spelling out "70" in reference to which anniversary was being celebrated.

Sooner or later, the sound of music and cheering began to float its way across the river.
