Good news, everyone! Interfake 1.10 is now available on npm. If you're not familiar with Interfake already, I recommend checking out the [Interfake GitHub repository](https://github.com/basicallydan/interfake). If you're an existing user, head over to your repo and do this:

```
npm install interfake --save
```

11 minor versions in, now, since release of v1 and somehow I am avoiding bumping a major version.

I probably would, if I were able to be more productive on the project. I do, of course, have clients.

I think from now on I'd like to take a more liberal approach to getting contributors. Mikeal of request fame tends to do that and look at where that got his popular library.
