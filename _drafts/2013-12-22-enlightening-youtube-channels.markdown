I simply cannot count the number of times I've sat down in front of my laptop, typed /r/videos into Reddit and spent the next hour flicking from one stupid YouTube video to the next. The existence of the random, the home-made, the cat-centric and the utterly ridiculous on YouTube is an existence of which I shall never, ever question the importance. YouTube is a melting pot of many different genres, and as the Web's central repository for videos this is just how it should be.

But contrary to popular misunderstanding, YouTube contains more than just the nonsense and personal vlogging it has a reputation for. YouTube is full of channels whose purposes seem to be, similar to that of the BBC: to inform, educate and entertain. Some YouTubers choose to record videos to explain concepts and share their armchair philosophy with the world in order to help create better thinkers.

I hope you'll agree with me when I say that there's always time for some random mindless nonsense, but every now and then it's nice to get an intellectual workout. So, without any further ado I present to you my six favourite YouTube channels for giving the brain something to *do* for once.

## It's okay to be smart

## The PBS Ideas Channel

Absolute classic, one of the most underrated channels on YouTube. @mikerugnetta (silent "g") is a fantastic public speaker and real class act. With his crew, each week a different idea is presented and discussed almost like a spoken essay. Mike's lengthly monologues never fail to capture my attention and the production value is incredibly high.

With subjects ranging from why Adventure Time is so popular with adults, to whether or not Digital Natives are even a real thing, Mike has introduced me to many concepts, and many different angles from which to approach these concepts.
