I simply cannot count the number of times I've sat down in front of my laptop, typed /r/videos into Reddit and spent the next hour flicking from one stupid YouTube video to the next. The existence of the random, the home-made, the cat-centric and the utterly ridiculous on YouTube is an existence of which I shall never, ever question the importance. YouTube is a melting pot of many different genres, and as the Web's central repository for videos this is just how it should be.

But contrary to popular misunderstanding, YouTube contains more than just the nonsense and personal vlogging it has a reputation for. YouTube is full of channels whose purposes seem to be, similar to that of the BBC: to inform, educate and entertain. Some YouTubers choose to record videos to explain concepts and share their armchair philosophy with the world in order to help create better thinkers.

I hope you'll agree with me when I say that there's always time for some random mindless nonsense, but every now and then it's nice to get an intellectual workout. So, without any further ado I present to you my six favourite YouTube channels for giving the brain something to *do* for once.

## [The PBS Ideas Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel)

Absolute classic, one of the most underrated channels on YouTube. [Mike Rugnetta](https://twitter.com/mikerugnetta) (silent "g") is a fantastic public speaker and real class act. With his crew, each week a different idea is presented and discussed almost like a spoken essay. Mike's lengthly monologues never fail to capture my attention and the production value is incredibly high.

With subjects ranging from why Adventure Time is so popular with adults, to whether or not Digital Natives are even a real thing, Mike has introduced me to many concepts, and many different angles from which to approach these concepts.

**Where to start?** ["Is YouTube making us smarter?"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qjge9U_MiA)
**Challenge me.** ["Is Buying Call of Duty a Moral Choice?"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeIHH0XEs6E)

## [The Brain Scoop](http://www.youtube.com/user/thebrainscoop)

**Where to start?** ["Horns vs. Antlers"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM7WJpVDi8E)

## [It's Okay To Be Smart](http://www.youtube.com/user/itsokaytobesmart)

[Joe Hanson](https://twitter.com/jtotheizzoe)'s calm, deliberate and thoughtful style of presentation makes [IOKTBS](http://www.youtube.com/user/itsokaytobesmart) really stand out from the crowd here. His videos largely cover topics from physics, biology, and psychology.

Sometimes, rather than covering a particular topic in one of those fields he'll help viewers to understand points of view to take in science, how properly to understand scientific concepts, and subjects *surrounding* science, such as [a video about Carl Sagan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ-WkDvC8EM) or [Nobel Prizes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1jurgfMwMM). Really easy to get into.

## [PBS Game/Show](http://www.youtube.com/user/pbsgameshow)

**Where to start?** ["Why Is LET'S PLAY So Huge?"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ9bpcdMd_U)
**Challenge me.** ["Would it Matter if Master Chief Were Gay?"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPVjgTG1Rqg)

## [CGP Grey](http://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey)

CGP Grey is probably one of the more well-known of this list thanks to his oft-viral videos. The style (illustrations and graphics) lend themselves well to quick bursts of information to be shared with a whole load of people.
